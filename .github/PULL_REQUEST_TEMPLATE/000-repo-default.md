  Repo-wide PR Template (Default)
  - Use this for general changes affecting the repository at large (CI, security, documentation, shared tooling, multi-component updates).
  - If your PR is strictly about the ZSH project under dot-config/zsh/, use the ZSH-specific template instead (e.g., 010-zsh-project.md).
  - Title guidance: Use one of feat/, fix/, docs/, chore/ followed by a short summary.
