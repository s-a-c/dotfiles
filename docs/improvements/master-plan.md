Status: Planning â€“ Foundational Docs Complete, Implementation Pending

## 1. Objectives
- Achieve â‰¥20% interactive startup time reduction vs baseline
- Consolidate active fragments into 11 redesign modules
- Enforce single `compinit` invocation & shared compdump
- Provide measurable, test-backed improvements (performance, security, structure)
- Automate regression detection (performance + integrity)

## 4. Metrics & Evidence
| Metric | Baseline Artifact | Target Artifact | Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Startup mean ms | perf-baseline.json | perf-current.json | -20% or better |
| File count active | manual count | structure-audit.json | =11 |
| Compinit runs | trace log | integration test output | =1 |
| Integrity async delay | timing log | timing log | > first prompt timestamp |
| Perf regression | quick perf JSON | badge delta | â‰¤5% daily drift |

## 5. Risk & Mitigation Matrix
| Risk | Trigger | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Hidden regression masked by variance | noisy timing | 10-run CI median & stddev tracking | require retest if stddev > 2x baseline |
| Async process crash silently | background failure | capture exit status + log | fallback synchronous scan |
| Over-consolidation reduces clarity | large module | keep size heuristics (<300 lines) | split by responsibility number slot remaining |
| Badge misreports due to missing baseline | file deleted | protect baseline file (chmod a-w) | reconstruct from backup metrics logs |

## 6. Testing Strategy (Summary)
See `../testing/strategy.md` for full taxonomy. Key guard tests: structure, compinit single-run, perf threshold, integrity deferred, async non-blocking, parity (aliases/prompt/history), regression sentinel.

## 7. Automation Hooks
| Hook | Purpose | Failure Action |
|------|---------|----------------|
| pre-commit | Fast tests + quick perf | Block commit |
| ci-core | Full category test matrix | Block merge |
| ci-performance | Drift detection + badge | Email + fail job |
| ci-security | Integrity & tamper tests | Email + fail job |
| nightly cron | Perf + light security summary | Email; no immediate block |
| weekly cron | Deep security & compdump refresh | Email; escalate if violations |

## 8. Acceptance / Exit Checklist
| Item | Status Marker |
|------|---------------|
| All core phases 1â€“9 complete | tags present |
| Performance improvement achieved | perf test PASS |
| Single compinit verified | integration log PASS |
| All enhancement tests green | CI matrix PASS |
| Maintenance automation active | cron logs + emails |

## 9. Deferred / Optional (Reassess Post-Promotion)
- Multi-shell (bash/fish) portability mapping
- Advanced security: signature-based plugin validation
- Performance flamegraph integration (zsh -x sampling)
