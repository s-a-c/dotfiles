# ZSH Config Redesign Part 08.13 - Workflow Reorganization Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed the reorganization of GitHub Actions workflows to consolidate ZSH-specific workflows into the main `.github/workflows/` directory with appropriate path filters and reduced duplication.

## Completed Actions

### 1. **Moved all ZSH workflows** from `dot-config/zsh/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/`

**Workflows moved:**
- `nightly-metrics.yml` → `zsh-nightly-metrics.yml`
- `perf-nightly.yml` → `zsh-perf-nightly.yml`
- `perf-structure-ci.yml` → `zsh-perf-structure-ci.yml`
- `publish-badges.yml` → `zsh-badges-and-metrics.yml` (consolidated)
- `redesign-flagged.yml` → `zsh-redesign-flagged.yml`
- `structure-badge.yml` → (consolidated into `zsh-badges-and-metrics.yml`)
- `zsh-test-redesign.yml` → `zsh-test-redesign.yml`

### 2. **Added path filters** to ZSH-specific workflows

All ZSH workflows now include path filters that trigger only when relevant files change:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
    paths:
      - 'dot-config/zsh/**'
      - '.github/workflows/zsh-*.yml'
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]
    paths:
      - 'dot-config/zsh/**'
      - '.github/workflows/zsh-*.yml'
```

**Path filters added to:**
- `zsh-nightly-metrics.yml`
- `zsh-perf-nightly.yml`
- `zsh-perf-structure-ci.yml`
- `zsh-badges-and-metrics.yml`
- `zsh-redesign-flagged.yml`
- `zsh-test-redesign.yml`
- `zsh-kit-ci.yml`
- `redesign-shim-audit-gate.yml`
- `ci-core.yml`
- `ci-perf-segments.yml`

### 3. **Kept core workflows** running on all changes

**Workflows without path filters (run on all changes):**
- `ci-security.yml` - Security must always run
- `secret-scan.yml` - Security scanning must always run
- `ci-prevent-ledger-commit.yml` - Policy enforcement must always run
- `ci-perf-ledger-nightly.yml` - Scheduled only (no push/PR triggers)
- `ci-variance-nightly.yml` - Scheduled only (no push/PR triggers)

### 4. **Consolidated similar workflows**

**Major consolidation:**
- Merged `publish-badges.yml` and `structure-badge.yml` into `zsh-badges-and-metrics.yml`
- This new workflow handles all badge generation, structure auditing, performance badges, and publishing to gh-pages
- Includes structure validation with pass/fail reporting
- Maintains auto-commit functionality for badge updates on main branch

**Duplicate removed:**
- Deleted `dot-config/zsh/.github/workflows/redesign-shim-audit-gate.yml` (duplicate)
- Updated main repo version with proper path filters

### 5. **Updated compliance headers**

All workflow files now have the updated compliance header:
```yaml
# Compliant with /Users/s-a-c/dotfiles/dot-config/ai/guidelines.md v900f08def0e6f7959ffd283aebb73b625b3473f5e49c57e861c6461b50a62ef2
```

## Final Workflow Organization

### ZSH-Specific Workflows (with path filters)
- `zsh-badges-and-metrics.yml` - Consolidated badge generation and publishing
- `zsh-kit-ci.yml` - ZSH kit tests and performance checks
- `zsh-nightly-metrics.yml` - Nightly metrics refresh
- `zsh-perf-nightly.yml` - Nightly performance capture
- `zsh-perf-structure-ci.yml` - Performance and structure CI
- `zsh-redesign-flagged.yml` - Redesign branch CI
- `zsh-test-redesign.yml` - Redesign testing workflow
- `redesign-shim-audit-gate.yml` - Shim audit gating
- `ci-core.yml` - Path enforcement
- `ci-perf-segments.yml` - Multi-sample perf segments
- `ci-async-guards.yml` - Async activation guards (already had path filters)

### Core Workflows (no path filters - run on all changes)
- `ci-security.yml` - Security testing
- `secret-scan.yml` - Secret scanning
- `ci-prevent-ledger-commit.yml` - Prevent perf ledger commits
- `badges-pages.yml` - General badge publishing
- `ci-performance.yml` - General performance CI

### Scheduled-Only Workflows (no path filters needed)
- `ci-perf-ledger-nightly.yml` - Nightly performance ledger
- `ci-variance-nightly.yml` - Nightly variance tracking

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Management**: All workflows now in single `.github/workflows/` directory
2. **Reduced CI Load**: ZSH workflows only trigger when ZSH files change
3. **Eliminated Duplication**: Removed duplicate shim audit workflow and consolidated badge workflows
4. **Improved Organization**: Clear naming convention with `zsh-` prefix for ZSH-specific workflows
5. **Maintained Security**: Core security and policy workflows still run on all changes
6. **Policy Compliance**: All workflows updated with correct compliance headers

## Directory Changes

- **Removed**: `dot-config/zsh/.github/` (entire directory)
- **Added**: 7 new ZSH-prefixed workflows in main `.github/workflows/`
- **Updated**: 4 existing workflows with path filters
- **Consolidated**: 2 workflows merged into 1

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify ZSH workflows only trigger when ZSH files change
2. Confirm security workflows still run on all commits
3. Test consolidated badge workflow produces all expected badges
4. Validate scheduled workflows continue running nightly
5. Ensure workflow_dispatch still works for manual triggers

## Future Opportunities

Additional consolidation opportunities identified for future implementation:
- Multiple nightly workflows could be further consolidated
- Performance workflows could be streamlined to reduce overlap
- Badge publishing workflows could be unified across the entire repository
