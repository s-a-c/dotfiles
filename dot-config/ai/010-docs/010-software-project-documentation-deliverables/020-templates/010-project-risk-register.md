# Project Risk Register
## [PROJECT_NAME]

**Estimated Reading Time:** 15 minutes

## Overview

This risk register identifies, assesses, and tracks potential risks that could impact the [PROJECT_NAME] project. Each risk is evaluated using a probability × impact matrix and includes specific mitigation strategies.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Probability Scale
- **Very Low (1)**: 0-10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2)**: 11-30% chance of occurrence  
- **Medium (3)**: 31-60% chance of occurrence
- **High (4)**: 61-85% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5)**: 86-100% chance of occurrence

### Impact Scale
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact on schedule, budget, or quality
- **Low (2)**: Minor delays or cost increases (< 5%)
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact on timeline or budget (5-15%)
- **High (4)**: Significant impact requiring major adjustments (15-30%)
- **Very High (5)**: Critical impact threatening project success (> 30%)

### Risk Score Calculation
**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**
- **1-4**: Low Risk (Green)
- **5-9**: Medium Risk (Yellow)  
- **10-16**: High Risk (Orange)
- **17-25**: Critical Risk (Red)

## Common Pitfalls and Avoidance Strategies

### Pitfall: Generic Risk Descriptions
**Problem**: Risks described too broadly (e.g., "technical issues")
**Solution**: Be specific about technology, component, or process affected
**Example**: Instead of "database issues" → "SQLite performance degradation with >10,000 concurrent users"

### Pitfall: Inconsistent Risk Scoring
**Problem**: Different team members apply scoring criteria differently
**Solution**: Provide specific examples for each probability and impact level
**Example**: Include reference scenarios for each score level

### Pitfall: Outdated Risk Information
**Problem**: Risk register becomes stale and loses relevance
**Solution**: Establish regular review cycles and assign clear ownership
**Example**: Weekly risk review in sprint planning, monthly comprehensive review

### Pitfall: Missing Mitigation Follow-up
**Problem**: Mitigation strategies defined but not tracked or executed
**Solution**: Integrate risk mitigation tasks into project management workflow
**Example**: Create specific tickets/tasks for each mitigation action
