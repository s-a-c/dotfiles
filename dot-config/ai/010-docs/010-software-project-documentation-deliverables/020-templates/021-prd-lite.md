```

### Example Technical Implementation

#### Laravel 12.x Configuration
```php
// bootstrap/providers.php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\TaskFlowServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\FilamentServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\SqliteServiceProvider::class,
];

// app/Models/Task.php
class Task extends Model
{
    use HasFactory, SoftDeletes, Userstamps, LogsActivity;

    protected $fillable = [
        'title', 'description', 'priority', 'status',
        'due_date', 'project_id', 'assigned_to'
    ];

    protected $casts = [
        'priority' => TaskPriority::class,
        'status' => TaskStatus::class,
        'due_date' => 'datetime',
    ];

    public function project(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Project::class);
    }

    public function assignee(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'assigned_to');
    }
}
```

#### FilamentPHP v4 Admin Panel
```php
// app/Filament/Resources/TaskResource.php
class TaskResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $model = Task::class;

    public static function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form->schema([
            TextInput::make('title')->required()->maxLength(255),
            Textarea::make('description')->rows(3),
            Select::make('priority')
                ->options(TaskPriority::class)
                ->required(),
            Select::make('status')
                ->options(TaskStatus::class)
                ->default(TaskStatus::Todo),
            DatePicker::make('due_date'),
            Select::make('project_id')
                ->relationship('project', 'name')
                ->required(),
            Select::make('assigned_to')
                ->relationship('assignee', 'name')
                ->searchable(),
        ]);
    }

    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title')->searchable()->sortable(),
            BadgeColumn::make('priority')->colors([
                'danger' => TaskPriority::High,
                'warning' => TaskPriority::Medium,
                'success' => TaskPriority::Low,
            ]),
            BadgeColumn::make('status'),
            TextColumn::make('assignee.name')->label('Assigned To'),
            TextColumn::make('due_date')->date()->sortable(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Example Success Metrics Implementation

#### MVP Success Tracking
```php
// app/Services/MetricsService.php
class MetricsService
{
    public function getTaskCompletionRate(): float
    {
        $totalTasks = Task::count();
        $completedTasks = Task::where('status', TaskStatus::Done)->count();

        return $totalTasks > 0 ? ($completedTasks / $totalTasks) * 100 : 0;
    }

    public function getAverageResponseTime(): float
    {
        // Implementation for tracking API response times
        return Cache::remember('avg_response_time', 300, function () {
            return DB::table('performance_logs')
                ->where('created_at', '>=', now()->subHour())
                ->avg('response_time');
        });
    }
}
```

### Example Risk Mitigation

#### Performance Bottleneck Mitigation
```php
// app/Providers/SqliteServiceProvider.php
class SqliteServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        if (config('database.default') === 'sqlite') {
            DB::statement('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL');
            DB::statement('PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL');
            DB::statement('PRAGMA cache_size=10000');
            DB::statement('PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY');
        }
    }
}

// Database optimization with proper indexing
Schema::table('tasks', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->index(['assigned_to', 'status']);
    $table->index(['project_id', 'due_date']);
    $table->index(['status', 'priority']);
});
```
