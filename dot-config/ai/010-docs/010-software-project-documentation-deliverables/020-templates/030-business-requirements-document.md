## Common Pitfalls and Avoidance Strategies

### Pitfall: Vague Business Objectives
**Problem**: Objectives like "improve efficiency" without specific metrics
**Solution**: Use SMART criteria with quantified targets
**Example**: Instead of "improve user productivity" → "reduce task completion time by 30% from 10 minutes to 7 minutes"

### Pitfall: Unrealistic Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Problem**: Overly optimistic benefits or underestimated costs
**Solution**: Use conservative estimates and include contingency
**Example**: Add 10-20% contingency to all cost estimates, validate benefits with historical data

### Pitfall: Missing Stakeholder Input
**Problem**: Requirements based on assumptions rather than stakeholder needs
**Solution**: Conduct structured interviews with all stakeholder groups
**Example**: Interview at least 3 representatives from each user group

### Pitfall: Technology-First Approach
**Problem**: Choosing technology before understanding business needs
**Solution**: Define business requirements first, then select appropriate technology
**Example**: Justify Laravel/FilamentPHP choice based on specific business needs

### Pitfall: Inadequate Change Management Planning
**Problem**: Focusing only on technical implementation, ignoring user adoption
**Solution**: Include comprehensive change management strategy
**Example**: Plan for training, communication, and support structures
