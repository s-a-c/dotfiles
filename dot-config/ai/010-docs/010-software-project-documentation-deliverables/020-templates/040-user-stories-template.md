## Story Estimation Guidelines

### Story Point Scale (Fibonacci)
- **1 Point**: Simple configuration change, minor UI update
- **2 Points**: Basic CRUD operation, simple form
- **3 Points**: Complex form with validation, basic integration
- **5 Points**: Feature with multiple components, moderate complexity
- **8 Points**: Complex feature with integrations, security considerations
- **13 Points**: Epic-level feature, requires breaking down

### Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Security criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance criteria met and validated
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (minimum 90% coverage)
- [ ] Feature tests written and passing
- [ ] Security tests written and passing
- [ ] Performance tests written and passing
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] GDPR compliance verified (if applicable)

## Common Pitfalls and Avoidance Strategies

### Pitfall: Vague Acceptance Criteria
**Problem**: Acceptance criteria that are too broad or ambiguous
**Solution**: Use specific, testable criteria with clear Given/When/Then format
**Example**: Instead of "User can manage data" → "Given I am on the data list page, When I click 'Edit' on a record, Then I see the edit form with current values populated"

### Pitfall: Missing Security Considerations
**Problem**: Forgetting to include security requirements in user stories
**Solution**: Always include security criteria section for every story
**Example**: Add authentication, authorization, input validation, and audit logging requirements

### Pitfall: Unrealistic Performance Expectations
**Problem**: Setting performance criteria without considering technical constraints
**Solution**: Base performance criteria on realistic benchmarks and user needs
**Example**: Research typical response times for similar applications and set achievable targets

### Pitfall: Insufficient Test Coverage Planning
**Problem**: Not planning comprehensive test coverage during story writing
**Solution**: Define specific test types and coverage expectations upfront
**Example**: Specify unit, feature, security, and performance tests for each story

### Pitfall: Ignoring GDPR Requirements
**Problem**: Not considering data protection requirements in user stories
**Solution**: Include GDPR considerations for any story involving personal data
**Example**: Add consent tracking, data export, and deletion capabilities where applicable

### Pitfall: Over-Sized Stories
**Problem**: Stories that are too large to complete in one sprint
**Solution**: Break down large stories into smaller, manageable pieces
**Example**: Split complex features into multiple stories focusing on specific user workflows
