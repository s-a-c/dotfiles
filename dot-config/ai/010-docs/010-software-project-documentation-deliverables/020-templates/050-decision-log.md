**Status**: Under Review  
**Confidence**: 3/5  
**Review Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Context**: Need to select primary key strategy that provides uniqueness, performance, and security benefits.

**Decision**: Use ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) for primary keys instead of auto-incrementing integers.

**Rationale**:
• Better security by not exposing sequential IDs
• Lexicographically sortable for better database performance

return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\EduFlowServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\FilamentServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\SqliteServiceProvider::class,
];

// Rapid development with Laravel conventions
class CourseController extends Controller
{
    public function store(StoreCourseRequest $request)
    {
        $course = Course::create($request->validated());

        activity()
            ->performedOn($course)
            ->causedBy(auth()->user())
            ->log('Course created');

        return redirect()->route('courses.index')
            ->with('success', 'Course created successfully');
    }
}
```

**Implementation Outcome**: ✅ **Successful**
- Admin panel completed 60% faster than estimated
- Instructors adapted to interface within 2 days
- Built-in permissions integration saved 1 week
- **Challenge**: Custom course enrollment workflow required additional development

**Code Example**:
```php
// app/Filament/Resources/CourseResource.php
class CourseResource extends Resource
{
    public static function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form->schema([
            TextInput::make('title')->required(),
            RichEditor::make('description'),
            Select::make('instructor_id')
                ->relationship('instructor', 'name')
                ->required(),
            Select::make('category_id')
                ->relationship('category', 'name'),
            Toggle::make('is_published')
                ->default(false),
        ]);
    }

    // Custom action for bulk enrollment
    public static function getActions(): array
    {
        return [
            Action::make('bulkEnroll')
                ->label('Bulk Enroll Students')
                ->form([
                    FileUpload::make('student_csv')
                        ->acceptedFileTypes(['text/csv'])
                ])
                ->action(function (array $data) {
                    // Custom enrollment logic
                }),
        ];
    }
}
```

#### ARCH-003: SQLite Database (Week 1)
**Implementation Outcome**: ⚠️ **Partially Successful**
- Development setup time: 2 minutes (exceeded goal)
- Test suite performance: 15 seconds (exceeded goal)
- **Issue**: Hit concurrent user limit at 300 users during beta
- **Resolution**: Migrated to PostgreSQL in Week 12

**Performance Optimization**:
```php
// app/Providers/SqliteServiceProvider.php
class SqliteServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        if (config('database.default') === 'sqlite') {
            DB::statement('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL');
            DB::statement('PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL');
            DB::statement('PRAGMA cache_size=10000');
            DB::statement('PRAGMA temp_store=MEMORY');

            // Custom optimization for course queries
            DB::statement('CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_enrollments_user_course
                          ON enrollments(user_id, course_id)');
        }
    }
}
```

#### TECH-001: Spatie Package Ecosystem (Week 3)
**Implementation Outcome**: ✅ **Excellent**
- Permission system: 1.5 days (vs. 2 days estimated)
- Activity logging: Comprehensive audit trail implemented
- Backup system: Automated daily backups working perfectly
- **Bonus**: Used spatie/laravel-sluggable for SEO-friendly URLs

**Implementation Example**:
```php
// app/Models/Course.php
class Course extends Model
{
    use HasFactory, SoftDeletes, Userstamps, LogsActivity, HasSlug;

    public function getActivitylogOptions(): LogOptions
    {
        return LogOptions::defaults()
            ->logOnly(['title', 'description', 'is_published'])
            ->logOnlyDirty()
            ->dontSubmitEmptyLogs();
    }

    public function getSlugOptions(): SlugOptions
    {
        return SlugOptions::create()
            ->generateSlugsFrom('title')
            ->saveSlugsTo('slug');
    }
}

// Usage in controller
public function show(Course $course)
{
    // Automatic route model binding with slug
    // URL: /courses/introduction-to-laravel-development
    return view('courses.show', compact('course'));
}
```

#### TECH-002: ULID Primary Keys (Week 5)
**Implementation Outcome**: ✅ **Successful with Learning Curve**
- Security improvement: No ID enumeration attacks
- Performance: 15% better insert performance than expected
- **Challenge**: Team needed 3 weeks to adapt (vs. 2 weeks estimated)
- **Solution**: Created helper tools and documentation

**Helper Tools Created**:
```php
// app/Console/Commands/UlidLookupCommand.php
class UlidLookupCommand extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'ulid:lookup {ulid}';

    public function handle()
    {
        $ulid = $this->argument('ulid');

        // Search across all models with ULID
        $models = [User::class, Course::class, Enrollment::class];

        foreach ($models as $model) {
            $record = $model::find($ulid);
            if ($record) {
                $this->info("Found in {$model}: {$record->title ?? $record->name}");
                $this->table(['Field', 'Value'],
                    collect($record->toArray())->map(fn($v, $k) => [$k, $v]));
                return;
            }
        }

        $this->error("ULID not found in any model");
    }
}
```
