## 5. Laravel-Specific Considerations

### 5.1 Environment Configuration

**Environment Management**:
```bash
# Environment-specific configurations
# .env.production
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=error

# Database configuration
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=${DB_HOST}
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE}
DB_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME}
DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}

# Cache configuration
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis

# Mail configuration
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=${MAIL_HOST}
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

### 5.2 Deployment Strategies

**Zero-Downtime Deployment**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Laravel deployment script
set -e

echo "Starting deployment..."

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate --force

# Clear and cache configurations
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Restart queue workers
php artisan queue:restart

# Restart PHP-FPM
sudo systemctl reload php8.2-fpm

echo "Deployment completed successfully!"
```

### 5.3 Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategies**:
- **OPcache**: PHP bytecode caching
- **Redis**: Session and cache storage
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery
- **Database Query Optimization**: Eager loading, indexing

**Queue Management**:
- **Horizon**: Redis queue monitoring
- **Supervisor**: Process management
- **Failed Job Handling**: Automatic retry mechanisms

## 6. Monitoring and Observability

### 6.1 Application Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Error rate and exception tracking
- Database query performance
- Queue processing metrics
- User session analytics

**Laravel Monitoring Tools**:
```php
// Custom metrics collection
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

class MetricsCollector
{
    public static function recordResponseTime($route, $time)
    {
        Log::channel('metrics')->info('response_time', [
            'route' => $route,
            'time' => $time,
            'timestamp' => now()
        ]);
    }
    
    public static function recordDatabaseQuery($query, $time)
    {
        if ($time > 1000) { // Log slow queries
            Log::channel('slow_queries')->warning('slow_query', [
                'query' => $query,
                'time' => $time
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Infrastructure Monitoring

**System Metrics**:
- CPU utilization and load average
- Memory usage and swap utilization
- Disk I/O and storage capacity
- Network throughput and latency

**Alert Thresholds**:
- CPU usage > 80% for 5 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% for 3 minutes
- Disk usage > 85%
- Response time > 2 seconds for 2 minutes

## 7. Security Integration

### 7.1 Security Scanning

**Automated Security Checks**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis for security issues
- Container image security scanning
- Infrastructure security compliance

**Laravel Security Best Practices**:
```php
// Security middleware configuration
// app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $middleware = [
    \App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
    \Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors::class,
    \App\Http\Middleware\PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance::class,
    \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ValidatePostSize::class,
    \App\Http\Middleware\TrimStrings::class,
    \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ConvertEmptyStringsToNull::class,
    \App\Http\Middleware\SecurityHeaders::class, // Custom security headers
];
```

### 7.2 Compliance and Auditing
