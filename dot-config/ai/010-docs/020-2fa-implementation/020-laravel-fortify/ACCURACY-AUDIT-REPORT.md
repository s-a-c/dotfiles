# Laravel Fortify 2FA Documentation - Accuracy Audit Report

**Audit Date**: 2025-07-01  
**Audited By**: Augment Agent  
**Audit Scope**: Complete verification against Laravel 12.x official documentation

## 🎯 Audit Objective

Comprehensive accuracy audit to ensure 100% compliance with official Laravel 12.x documentation and eliminate all fictional commands or procedures from the Laravel Fortify 2FA implementation documentation.

## 📋 Critical Issues Identified & Corrected

### 1. **Laravel Sanctum Installation Method** ✅ CORRECTED

**Issue**: Documentation incorrectly used manual Composer installation
```bash
# ❌ INCORRECT (Previous)
composer require laravel/sanctum "^4.1"
```

**Fix**: Replaced with Laravel 12.x official method
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT (Updated)
php artisan install:api  # Official Laravel 12.x method
```

**Source Verification**: [Laravel 12.x Sanctum Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/sanctum)
> "You may install Laravel Sanctum via the install:api Artisan command"

### 2. **Non-existent Artisan Commands** ✅ CORRECTED

#### 2.1 `php artisan fortify:validate-migration` - REMOVED
**Issue**: This command does not exist in Laravel Fortify package
**Replacement**: Manual validation using `php artisan tinker`
```bash
# ❌ FICTIONAL COMMAND
php artisan fortify:validate-migration

# ✅ REAL ALTERNATIVE
php artisan tinker
>>> User::whereNotNull('two_factor_secret')->count()
>>> exit
```

#### 2.2 `php artisan user:validate-model` - REMOVED
**Issue**: This command does not exist
**Replacement**: Manual model testing
```bash
# ❌ FICTIONAL COMMAND
php artisan user:validate-model

# ✅ REAL ALTERNATIVE
php artisan tinker
>>> $user = User::first()
>>> $user->hasEnabledTwoFactorAuthentication()
>>> exit
```

#### 2.3 `php artisan health:check` - REMOVED
**Issue**: This is not a standard Laravel command
**Replacement**: Standard Laravel testing
```bash
# ❌ FICTIONAL COMMAND
php artisan health:check

# ✅ REAL ALTERNATIVE
php artisan test
php artisan route:list | grep fortify
```

#### 2.4 `php artisan fortify:rollback-migration --force` - REMOVED
**Issue**: This command does not exist
**Replacement**: Standard Laravel migration rollback
```bash
# ❌ FICTIONAL COMMAND
php artisan fortify:rollback-migration --force

# ✅ REAL ALTERNATIVE
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=3
```
