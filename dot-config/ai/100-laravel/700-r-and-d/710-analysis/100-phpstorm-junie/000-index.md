## 1. Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of the architectural patterns, principles, and composer packages found in the research and development materials. The analysis covers:

1. Architectural patterns and principles
2. Composer packages and their capabilities
3. Inconsistencies between architectural patterns
4. Implementation recommendations

## 2. Document Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1. Architectural Patterns

The research and development materials demonstrate several key architectural patterns:

- **Event Sourcing and CQRS**: 
  - Prioritizing `hirethunk/verbs` as the primary event sourcing library
  - Using `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` to extend capabilities
  - Sharing a single event-store for complete audit trail and consistency
  - Used for complete audit trails, separation of concerns, and optimized read models

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Implemented with bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, and aggregates

- **Finite State Machines**: 
  - Using PHP 8.4 Native Enums as the foundation, enhanced with labels and colors
  - Prioritizing `spatie/laravel-model-states` for complex workflows
  - Prioritizing `spatie/laravel-model-status` for simple status tracking

- **Single Table Inheritance (STI)**: Used for hierarchical models like User and Organisation

### 3.2. Core Technologies

The core technologies identified include:

- **PHP**: 8.4+
- **Laravel**: 12.x
- **FrankenPHP/Octane**: For high-performance PHP execution
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Redis**: Caching and queues
- **Livewire with Volt and Flux UI**: Frontend framework with Alpine.js for client-side reactivity
- **Filament in SPA mode**: Single-page application experience for admin panel
- **Volt SFC**: Single File Components for non-admin UI

### 3.3. Package Highlights

Key package categories include:

- **Admin Panel and UI**: FilamentPHP ecosystem in SPA mode with Flux UI integration
- **Event Sourcing**: 
  - `hirethunk/verbs` (primary) for modern, type-safe command handling
  - `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` (supporting) for extending capabilities
  - Single event-store for complete audit trail

- **State Management**: 
  - `spatie/laravel-model-states` (primary) for complex state workflows
  - `spatie/laravel-model-status` (primary) for simple status tracking
  - Enhanced PHP 8.4 Native Enums with labels and colors

- **Frontend and UI**: Livewire, Flux, Volt SFC, and Alpine.js plugins
- **Performance Optimization**: Laravel Octane, Scout, Typesense
- **Data Management**: Spatie packages for data handling

### 3.4. Initial Business Capabilities

The following business capabilities are planned for future implementation:

- **CMS**: 
  - Categories/Taxonomies (self-referential, polymorphic)
  - Long-form posts (Blog) with lifecycle management
  - Newsletter with subscription management
  - Forums

- **Social**: 
  - Presence
  - Short-form posts
  - Real-time chat
  - Comments and reactions
  - Mentions and notifications
  - Follow/followers
  - Chat rooms

- **Project Management**: 
  - Kanban board
  - Calendars
  - Tasks with lifecycle management

- **Media**: 
  - Sharing
  - Avatars for users and organisations

- **eCommerce**: 
  - Products
  - Services
  - Carts
  - Orders
  - Subscriptions

## 4. Next Steps

For detailed information on each topic, please refer to the specific documentation files listed in the Document Structure section. The implementation recommendations document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing these architectural patterns, packages, and business capabilities.
