## 2. Critical Architectural Decisions

### 2.1. Event Sourcing Strategy 🔴

**Decision Required:** Primary event sourcing package selection

**Options Analysis:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Confidence |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| **hirethunk/verbs only** | Modern PHP 8.4+, clean API, active development | Newer package, smaller community | **85%** |
| **spatie/laravel-event-sourcing only** | Mature, well-tested, large community | May not leverage PHP 8.4 features | **90%** |
| **Hybrid approach** | Best of both worlds, gradual migration | Complexity, dual maintenance | **65%** |

**🎯 AI Recommendation:** Use `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` as primary with selective `hirethunk/verbs` integration

**Reasoning:**
- Spatie package has 3+ years production battle-testing
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Lower implementation risk for team unfamiliar with event sourcing
- Can introduce hirethunk/verbs for specific PHP 8.4 features later

**Confidence Score: 88%** - Based on risk assessment and team experience factors

**Impact if delayed:** Implementation timeline extends by 1-2 weeks due to architecture uncertainty

---

### 2.2. Database Migration Strategy 🔴

**Decision Required:** SQLite to PostgreSQL migration approach

**Options Analysis:**

| Approach | Timeline | Risk Level | Data Integrity | Confidence |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Fresh start** | 1 day | Low | ✅ Clean slate | **95%** |
| **Schema migration** | 3-5 days | Medium | ✅ Preserved | **80%** |
| **Gradual migration** | 2-3 weeks | High | ⚠️ Complex | **60%** |

**🎯 AI Recommendation:** Fresh start with data export/import utilities

**Reasoning:**
- Current SQLite contains minimal production data
- Event sourcing requires different schema approach
- Fresh PostgreSQL setup optimized for event store performance
- Lower risk than complex migration scripts

**Confidence Score: 92%** - Clear technical advantages with minimal downside

**Implementation Details:**
```bash
# Recommended migration steps
1. Export current user data to seeders
2. Create new PostgreSQL event store schema
3. Implement STI models from scratch
4. Import essential data via migrations
```

**Impact if delayed:** Event sourcing implementation blocked, 1-week delay minimum

### 2.3. PHP Version Upgrade Path 🔴

**Decision Required:** PHP 8.2 → 8.4 upgrade timeline and approach

**Current State:** PHP 8.2 (production-ready)  
**Target State:** PHP 8.4 (cutting-edge, required for some packages)

**Risk Assessment:**

| Factor | Risk Level | Mitigation | Confidence |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Package Compatibility** | Medium | Test all packages in staging | **85%** |
| **Hosting Support** | Low | Most providers support 8.4 | **95%** |
| **Team Familiarity** | Low | PHP 8.4 is evolutionary | **90%** |
| **Deployment Pipeline** | Medium | Update CI/CD configurations | **80%** |

**🎯 AI Recommendation:** Immediate upgrade to PHP 8.4

**Reasoning:**
- Multiple target packages require PHP 8.4
- Enhanced enums with methods needed for STI implementation
- Performance improvements for event sourcing
- readonly properties reduce memory usage

**Confidence Score: 87%** - Strong technical case with manageable risks

**Impact if delayed:** Cannot install several required packages, architecture compromised
