# 000-Index

Welcome to the "Refinement" phase for the GPT-4.1 analysis. This folder will contain:

1. 005-architectural-patterns.md – How we’ll fix (or at least document) the patterns
2. 010-dependency-tree.md – Dependency wrangling and installability improvements
3. 015-capabilities-and-features.md – Feature enablement, with extra colour
4. 020-inconsistencies.md – How we’ll avoid (or at least name-and-shame) the gotchas

Navigate with even more caution. Expect more diagrams, more sarcasm, and hopefully fewer bugs.
