# 1. Architectural Patterns & Principles – Refinement

## 1.1. Goals
- Refactor all models to use event sourcing, STI, and enums consistently.
- Document all architectural decisions (with diagrams, because you’re a visual learner).

## 1.2. Next Steps
- Audit UME, LSF, LFS for event sourcing.
- Standardise STI and enum usage.
- Add a mermaid diagram for the new architecture (coming soon).
