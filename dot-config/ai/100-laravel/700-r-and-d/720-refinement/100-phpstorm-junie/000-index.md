## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1. Analysis Sources

The refinement is based on analyses from the following sources:

- **PhpStorm Junie**: Comprehensive analysis of architectural patterns, packages, dependency tree, and implementation recommendations
- **VSC GHCP Claude Sonnet 4**: Detailed analysis with focus on architectural patterns, enhanced enums, Alpine.js integration, and configuration requirements
- **VSC GHCP Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Concise analysis of architectural patterns and packages
- **VSC GHCP GPT-4.1**: Focused analysis with specific attention to inconsistencies

### 3.2. Core Architectural Patterns

The analyses consistently identify the following core architectural patterns:

- **Event Sourcing and CQRS**: For complete audit trails, separation of concerns, and optimized read models
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: For organizing complex business domains
- **Finite State Machines**: For managing complex state transitions
- **Single Table Inheritance (STI)**: For hierarchical models

### 3.3. Implementation Phases

The implementation is recommended to be carried out in phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure, authentication, and basic UI
2. **Core Features Phase**: Essential business capabilities
3. **Advanced Features Phase**: Enhanced business capabilities
4. **Integration Phase**: Third-party integrations and extensions

### 3.4. Next Steps

The recommended next steps include:

1. Setting up the development environment
2. Implementing the core infrastructure
3. Developing the authentication system
4. Creating the basic UI components
5. Implementing the first business capabilities
