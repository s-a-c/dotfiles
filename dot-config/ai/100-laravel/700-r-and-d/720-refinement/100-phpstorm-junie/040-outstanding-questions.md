## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the outstanding questions, decisions, and inconsistencies identified in the analysis of the Laravel architectural patterns and packages. For each item, recommendations are provided along with confidence levels to assist in decision-making.

## 2. Event Sourcing Strategy

### 2.1. Dual Event Sourcing Packages

**Issue:** The analyses identified the use of both `hirethunk/verbs` and `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` for event sourcing, which could lead to confusion, duplication, and increased complexity.

**Options:**
1. Use only `hirethunk/verbs` as the primary event sourcing package
2. Use only `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` as the primary event sourcing package
3. Use both packages with clearly defined boundaries and responsibilities

**Recommendation:** Use `hirethunk/verbs` as the primary event sourcing package, with `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` used only for specific functionality not available in `hirethunk/verbs`. Define clear boundaries between the two packages to avoid confusion and duplication.

**Confidence:** 85% - `hirethunk/verbs` appears to be the preferred package in the analyses, but there may be specific functionality in `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` that is valuable. A hybrid approach with clear boundaries is likely the most pragmatic solution.

### 2.2. Event Store Implementation

**Issue:** The analyses mention a single event store for complete audit trails, but don't specify the implementation details or how it will scale with large volumes of events.

**Options:**
1. Use a dedicated event store database (e.g., EventStoreDB)
2. Use PostgreSQL with JSON columns for events
3. Use a hybrid approach with recent events in PostgreSQL and older events archived

**Recommendation:** Start with PostgreSQL for the event store, using JSON columns for event data. Implement a strategy for archiving older events to maintain performance. Consider a dedicated event store solution if event volume becomes a concern.

**Confidence:** 75% - PostgreSQL is a solid starting point for event storage, but the optimal solution depends on expected event volume and query patterns. A hybrid approach provides flexibility as the application scales.

## 3. Frontend Strategy

### 3.1. Multiple JavaScript Frameworks

**Issue:** The analyses identified the use of multiple JavaScript frameworks (Alpine.js, Vue.js, Inertia), which could lead to inconsistency, increased learning curve, and maintenance challenges.

**Options:**
1. Standardize on Alpine.js for all client-side interactivity
2. Use Vue.js for all components, including admin
3. Use a hybrid approach with clear boundaries (e.g., Alpine.js for simple interactions, Vue.js for complex components)

**Recommendation:** Use a hybrid approach with clear boundaries: Alpine.js for simple interactions and Livewire components, Vue.js for more complex components where needed. Ensure that the frameworks don't overlap in responsibility and are used consistently across the application.

**Confidence:** 80% - A hybrid approach leverages the strengths of each framework while minimizing complexity. The key is to establish clear guidelines for when to use each framework.

### 3.2. Admin UI Implementation

**Issue:** The analyses mention using Filament in SPA mode for the admin panel, but don't specify how it will integrate with the rest of the application or how to handle custom admin functionality.

**Options:**
1. Use Filament exclusively for admin functionality
2. Build custom admin functionality with Livewire/Volt
3. Use a hybrid approach with Filament for standard CRUD and custom components for specialized functionality

**Recommendation:** Use Filament as the primary admin framework, leveraging its plugin ecosystem for standard functionality. For specialized admin features, create custom Livewire components that integrate with Filament's design system. This provides a consistent admin experience while allowing for custom functionality.

**Confidence:** 90% - Filament is well-suited for admin interfaces and has a rich plugin ecosystem. The ability to extend it with custom components provides the necessary flexibility.

## 4. Database and Model Design

### 4.1. Single Table Inheritance Implementation

**Issue:** The analyses recommend using `tightenco/parental` for Single Table Inheritance (STI), but don't address potential issues with tables having many nullable columns if subtypes have very different attributes.

**Options:**
1. Use STI with all attributes in a single table
2. Use a hybrid approach with common attributes in the base table and type-specific attributes in related tables
3. Use JSON columns for type-specific attributes

**Recommendation:** Use a hybrid approach: implement STI with `tightenco/parental` for common attributes, and use related tables or JSON columns for type-specific attributes that would otherwise result in many nullable columns. This balances the benefits of STI with database normalization.

**Confidence:** 85% - This approach addresses the potential issues with STI while maintaining its benefits. The specific implementation details will depend on the attributes of each model type.

### 4.2. Multi-tenancy Strategy

**Issue:** The analyses mention multi-tenancy but don't specify the implementation approach (e.g., separate databases, schema-based, row-based).

**Options:**
1. Database-per-tenant
2. Schema-per-tenant
3. Row-based multi-tenancy with tenant ID columns

**Recommendation:** Implement row-based multi-tenancy with tenant ID columns, using Laravel's global scopes to automatically filter queries by tenant. This approach is simpler to implement and maintain, while still providing adequate isolation between tenants.

**Confidence:** 70% - Row-based multi-tenancy is a good starting point, but the optimal approach depends on specific requirements for tenant isolation, data volume, and regulatory compliance. This recommendation may need to be revisited based on these factors.

## 5. Package Conflicts and Compatibility

### 5.1. Filament Plugin Compatibility

**Issue:** The analyses mention numerous Filament plugins, which could lead to conflicts or compatibility issues, especially as Filament evolves.

**Options:**
1. Install all plugins at once
2. Install plugins incrementally as needed
3. Create a compatibility matrix and test combinations before implementation

**Recommendation:** Install Filament plugins incrementally as needed, starting with the core plugins required for basic functionality. Test each plugin thoroughly before adding more, and maintain a compatibility matrix documenting tested combinations.

**Confidence:** 95% - An incremental approach minimizes the risk of conflicts and allows for thorough testing of each plugin. This is a standard best practice for managing complex plugin ecosystems.

### 5.2. Development Dependencies

**Issue:** The analyses list numerous development dependencies, which could lead to conflicts, increased build times, and maintenance challenges.

**Options:**
1. Install all development dependencies at once
2. Install development dependencies incrementally as needed
3. Create a minimal set of essential development dependencies

**Recommendation:** Start with a minimal set of essential development dependencies (PHPStan, Larastan, Pint, Pest) and add others incrementally as needed. Focus on tools that provide the most value for code quality and testing.

**Confidence:** 90% - A minimal approach reduces complexity and potential conflicts while still providing essential development tools. Additional tools can be added as specific needs arise.

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1. Event Sourcing Performance

**Issue:** Event sourcing can lead to performance issues, especially with large event stores and complex projections.

**Options:**
1. Implement aggressive caching of projections
2. Use read models optimized for specific query patterns
3. Implement event snapshots to reduce replay time
4. Use a combination of these approaches

**Recommendation:** Implement a comprehensive performance strategy: use read models optimized for specific query patterns, implement aggressive caching of projections, and use event snapshots for aggregates with many events. Monitor performance metrics and adjust the strategy as needed.

**Confidence:** 80% - This multi-faceted approach addresses the common performance challenges with event sourcing. The specific optimizations will depend on the application's usage patterns and event volume.

### 6.2. Real-time Feature Scalability

**Issue:** Real-time features using WebSockets can face scalability challenges with many concurrent connections.

**Options:**
1. Use Laravel Reverb with horizontal scaling
2. Implement a fallback to polling for non-critical updates
3. Use a third-party service like Pusher
4. Use a combination of these approaches

**Recommendation:** Start with Laravel Reverb for WebSockets, but implement a fallback to polling for non-critical updates. Design the system to be horizontally scalable, and consider using a third-party service like Pusher if scaling becomes a challenge.

**Confidence:** 75% - This approach provides flexibility and fallback options, but the optimal solution depends on the specific real-time requirements and expected user load.

## 7. Business Capability Prioritization

### 7.1. Feature Scope

**Issue:** The analyses identify numerous business capabilities (CMS, Social, Project Management, Media, eCommerce), but don't provide clear guidance on prioritization.

**Options:**
1. Implement all capabilities in parallel
2. Prioritize based on business value
3. Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) and expand incrementally

**Recommendation:** Start with a minimal viable product focused on the core capabilities that provide the most business value. Prioritize features based on user needs and business goals, and implement them incrementally in the order of priority.

**Confidence:** 90% - An incremental approach based on business value is a standard best practice for managing complex projects. This allows for early feedback and adjustment of priorities.

### 7.2. eCommerce Implementation

**Issue:** The analyses mention eCommerce capabilities but don't specify whether to build custom functionality or integrate with existing solutions.

**Options:**
1. Build custom eCommerce functionality from scratch
2. Integrate with an existing eCommerce platform (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce)
3. Use a Laravel-specific eCommerce package

**Recommendation:** Start with basic custom eCommerce functionality for simple products and services. For more complex eCommerce needs, consider integrating with an established platform or using a Laravel-specific package. This provides flexibility while leveraging existing solutions for complex functionality.

**Confidence:** 70% - The optimal approach depends on the specific eCommerce requirements and the importance of customization vs. time-to-market. This recommendation may need to be revisited based on these factors.

## 8. Team and Resource Considerations

### 8.1. Team Expertise

**Issue:** The analyses mention the need for senior Laravel developers with event sourcing experience, but don't address the potential learning curve for the team.

**Options:**
1. Hire developers with specific experience in the required technologies
2. Train existing team members on the new technologies
3. Use a hybrid approach with some hiring and some training

**Recommendation:** Use a hybrid approach: bring in at least one senior developer with experience in event sourcing and the key architectural patterns, while providing training and mentorship for existing team members. Create a knowledge sharing program to build expertise across the team.

**Confidence:** 85% - This approach balances the need for immediate expertise with long-term team development. The specific mix of hiring vs. training will depend on the current team composition and budget constraints.

### 8.2. Development Timeline

**Issue:** The analyses suggest a 12-18 month timeline for full implementation, but don't address how to manage stakeholder expectations or deliver value incrementally.

**Options:**
1. Commit to the full timeline upfront
2. Break the project into smaller releases with incremental value
3. Use a continuous delivery approach with frequent small releases

**Recommendation:** Adopt a continuous delivery approach with frequent small releases, focusing on delivering incremental value. Define clear milestones with demonstrable business value, and communicate progress regularly to stakeholders. This allows for feedback and adjustment throughout the project.

**Confidence:** 95% - Continuous delivery is a well-established best practice for managing complex projects. It reduces risk, provides early feedback, and allows for course correction.
