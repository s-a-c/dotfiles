   - **Integration:** REST API, SDK available

5. **No Scanning + Enhanced Validation**
   - **Pros:** No external dependencies, no latency, simplest implementation
   - **Cons:** Limited security, relies solely on file extension/MIME type validation
   - **Cost:** Free
   - **Integration:** Built into Laravel's validation system

**Implementation Considerations:**

1. **File Types to Scan:**
   - High-risk: Executables (.exe, .dll, .bat), scripts (.js, .php, .py), Office documents with macros (.docm, .xlsm)
   - Medium-risk: PDFs, archives (.zip, .rar), standard Office documents (.docx, .xlsx)
   - Low-risk: Images (.jpg, .png, .gif), plain text (.txt)

2. **Handling Potentially Malicious Files:**
   - Option A: Reject immediately with clear user feedback
   - Option B: Quarantine in isolated storage for admin review
   - Option C: Allow with warning for certain user roles (admin only)

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Pre-upload client-side validation (file type, size)
   - Post-upload server-side validation before processing
   - Asynchronous scanning with temporary storage
   - Integration with `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` conversion pipeline

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Implement timeouts for external API calls
   - Queue scanning for large files
   - Cache results for previously scanned files (hash-based)
   - Progressive scanning (quick check first, deep scan if suspicious)

5. **Fallback Mechanisms:**
   - Configurable fallback behavior if scanning service is unavailable
   - Options: block all uploads, allow with logging, allow specific file types

**Preliminary Recommendation:**
Implement a tiered approach based on file risk level:
1. High-risk files: Full virus scanning using either ClamAV (self-hosted) or OPSWAT MetaDefender (cloud)
2. Medium-risk files: Scanning with configurable fallback options
3. Low-risk files: Enhanced validation only (extension, MIME type, content analysis)

This approach balances security, performance, and cost considerations while providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

**Decision:** Implement a restricted tiered approach for file uploads:
1. **Initial Phase (v1.0)**: Only low-risk files permitted (images, plain text)
   - Enhanced validation only (extension, MIME type, content analysis)
   - No external virus scanning service required
2. **Future Phase**: Medium-risk files (PDFs, standard Office documents) using OPSWAT MetaDefender
   - Not included in initial release
   - Will be implemented in a later version
3. **Not on Roadmap**: High-risk files (executables, scripts, Office documents with macros)
   - These file types will not be supported

This approach prioritizes security while minimizing implementation complexity and cost for the initial release.

**Status:** Resolved - Restricted tiered approach with only low-risk files permitted initially.

### 8.8. Frontend Approach Clarification [RESOLVED]
<details>
<summary><strong>Issue:</strong> Clarification needed on Livewire/Volt functional paradigm</summary>

**Description:**
The decision log mentions using "Livewire/Volt functional paradigm SFC as primary endpoint technology" (section 6.2), but this approach is not explicitly mentioned in the PRD or TAD.

**Impact:**
This could lead to confusion during implementation and potentially inconsistent frontend development approaches.

**Clarification:**
Livewire/Volt functional paradigm refers to using Livewire's Volt Single File Components (SFC) with a functional programming approach rather than class-based components. Key aspects include:

1. **When to use Volt vs. traditional Livewire components:**
   - Use Volt SFCs for most user-facing pages and components
   - Use traditional class-based Livewire components for complex components with extensive logic or when extending existing components
   - Use Volt for rapid development and improved readability

2. **Guidelines for implementing the functional paradigm:**
   - Organize Volt components in feature-based directories
   - Use state functions for managing component state
   - Leverage computed properties for derived values
   - Implement actions as pure functions where possible
   - Use hooks for lifecycle management

3. **Integration with CQRS pattern:**
   - Volt components can dispatch commands via the `hirethunk/verbs` command bus
   - Use dedicated action functions to encapsulate command creation and dispatch
   - Implement query functions that call query services or repositories
   - Separate read and write operations within the component

**Example Volt Component:**
```php
<?php

use function Livewire\Volt\{state, computed, mount, action};
use App\Commands\CreateTodo;
use App\Queries\GetTodosByUser;
use Hirethunk\Verbs\CommandBus;

// State declaration
state([
    'title' => '',
    'description' => '',
    'todos' => [],
]);

// Lifecycle hook
mount(function (CommandBus $commandBus) {
    $this->todos = app(GetTodosByUser::class)->execute(auth()->id());
});

// Computed property
computed(function () {
    return count($this->todos);
})->as('todoCount');

// Action with CQRS command
action(function (CommandBus $commandBus) {
    $command = new CreateTodo([
        'title' => $this->title,
        'description' => $this->description,
        'user_id' => auth()->id(),
    ]);

    $result = $commandBus->dispatch($command);

    if ($result->wasSuccessful()) {
        $this->title = '';
        $this->description = '';
        $this->todos = app(GetTodosByUser::class)->execute(auth()->id());
        $this->dispatch('todo-created');
    }
})->as('createTodo');
```text

**Recommendation:**
Update the TAD to explicitly describe the Livewire/Volt functional paradigm approach with the details provided above.

**Status:** Resolved - TAD will be updated to include detailed information about the Livewire/Volt functional paradigm approach.
