</div>

### 1.1. Exercise 1 Answers

**Task:** Open the `010-010-ela-prd-class.plantuml` diagram. Identify the `USER`, `POST`, and `COMMENTS` classes. For each of these three classes:
  a. List two attributes shown in the diagram.
  b. Briefly describe the likely purpose of the class in the E_L_A system.

**Answer:**

1.  **`USER` Class:**
    a.  **Attributes:** `+email`, `+status` (others include `id`, `slug`, `password`, etc.)
    b.  **Purpose:** Represents individuals who interact with the system, such as authors, administrators, or general users. It stores their identification, authentication details, and status.

2.  **`POST` Class:**
    a.  **Attributes:** `+title`, `+content` (others include `id`, `slug`, `user_id`, `status`, etc.)
    b.  **Purpose:** Represents content entries like articles, blog posts, or announcements within the application. It holds the main body of the content, its title, and metadata like author and publication status.

3.  **`COMMENTS` Class:** (Note: The class is named `COMMENTS` in the diagram)
    a.  **Attributes:** `+comment`, `+approved` (others include `id`, `commentable_type`, `commentable_id`, `commenter_id`, etc.)
    b.  **Purpose:** Represents user-generated comments that can be attached to other entities (like `POST`s or `TODO`s) in the system. It stores the comment text, approval status, and links to the item being commented on and the user who made the comment.

### 1.2. Exercise 2 Answers

**Task:** Find the relationship `TEAM "1" --o "*" CATEGORY : hasCategories` in the E_L_A PRD Class Diagram.
  a. What type of relationship does this primarily represent (Association, Aggregation, Composition)? Explain your reasoning based on the notation and context.
  b. What does the multiplicity `"1"` and `"*"` signify in this specific relationship?

**Answer:**

a.  **Relationship Type:** This primarily represents an **Aggregation** relationship, though it's a strong association that leans towards aggregation.
    *   **Reasoning:** The open circle `o` on the `CATEGORY` side of the `TEAM` class (`TEAM "1" --o "*" CATEGORY`) typically indicates that `TEAM` is the "whole" and `CATEGORY` is a "part". While a `CATEGORY` is strongly associated with a `TEAM` (as indicated by `team_id <<FK,NN,IDX>>` in `CATEGORY`), the `o` suggests that if a `TEAM` is deleted, its `CATEGORY`s might not necessarily be deleted (though business logic could enforce this). Categories are grouped under a team. If it were composition (filled diamond), deleting the team would imply mandatory deletion of its categories. Since it's an open circle, it's more of a "has-a" relationship where categories belong to a team but could potentially be re-assigned or exist if the team concept was altered (less likely given the `NN` foreign key, but the UML notation suggests aggregation over composition).

b.  **Multiplicity:**
    *   `"1"` next to `TEAM`: Signifies that a `CATEGORY` record must belong to exactly one `TEAM`.
    *   `"*"` next to `CATEGORY`: Signifies that a `TEAM` can have zero, one, or many `CATEGORY` records associated with it.

### 1.3. Exercise 3 Answers

**Task:** What is the purpose of the `CONVERSATION` and `MESSAGE` classes in the E_L_A PRD Class Diagram? How are they related? Describe the relationship line connecting them (e.g., `CONVERSATION "1" --o "*" MESSAGE : hasMessages`).

**Answer:**

*   **Purpose of `CONVERSATION`:** Represents a thread or a container for a sequence of messages. It could be a direct message between users, a group chat, or a comment thread associated with a specific topic. It has attributes like `uuid`, `name` (optional), and `type`.
*   **Purpose of `MESSAGE`:** Represents an individual message sent within a `CONVERSATION`. It contains the actual `body` of the message, a link to the `conversation_id` it belongs to, and the `user_id` of the sender.
*   **Relationship:** The line `CONVERSATION "1" --o "*" MESSAGE : hasMessages` describes a **one-to-many aggregation** relationship.
    *   **Explanation:** One `CONVERSATION` can contain (has) zero, one, or many (`*`) `MESSAGE`s. Each `MESSAGE` belongs to exactly one (`1`) `CONVERSATION`. The `o` on the `MESSAGE` side suggests that messages are parts of a conversation; if a conversation is deleted, its messages would typically also be deleted or become inaccessible. The label "hasMessages" clarifies the nature of the relationship.

### 1.4. Exercise 4 Answers

**Task:** Look at the `ROLE` and `PERMISSION` classes.
  a. How are they related according to the diagram (e.g., `ROLE "*" -- "*" PERMISSION : role_has_permissions (Pivot)`)?
  b. What does "(Pivot)" likely mean in this context?
  c. Why is this type of relationship useful for managing user permissions?

**Answer:**

a.  **Relationship:** The diagram shows `ROLE "*" -- "*" PERMISSION : role_has_permissions (Pivot)`. This is a **many-to-many association**.
    *   A `ROLE` can have multiple `PERMISSION`s.
    *   A `PERMISSION` can be assigned to multiple `ROLE`s.

b.  **"(Pivot)":** This indicates that the many-to-many relationship is implemented using an intermediate table, commonly called a pivot table. In Laravel (which this diagram seems to be for), this table would typically be named `role_has_permissions` (as suggested by the label) or `permission_role`. This pivot table would have at least two columns: `role_id` and `permission_id`, forming a composite primary key, to link records from the `ROLE` and `PERMISSION` tables.

c.  **Usefulness:** This type of relationship is extremely useful for managing user permissions because it provides great flexibility:
    *   **Granular Control:** You can define specific permissions (e.g., "create-post", "edit-user", "delete-comment") and then group them into roles (e.g., "Administrator", "Editor", "Author", "Subscriber").
    *   **Reusability:** Roles can be assigned to many users. If you need to change the permissions for a group of users, you only need to modify the permissions assigned to their role, rather than changing permissions for each user individually.
    *   **Scalability:** As the application grows, you can easily add new permissions and roles or adjust existing ones without major structural changes to the `USER`, `ROLE`, or `PERMISSION` tables themselves.

### 1.5. Exercise 5 Answers

**Task:** The diagram shows a `MEDIA` class and mentions it in relationships like `USER "1" -- "*" MEDIA : hasAvatar (Polymorphic)` and `POST "*" -- "*" MEDIA : hasMedia (Polymorphic)`.
  a. What does "(Polymorphic)" suggest about how the `MEDIA` class is used?
  b. List at least two attributes you see in the `MEDIA` class definition.
  c. Why would a system use a polymorphic relationship for media assets?

**Answer:**

a.  **"(Polymorphic)":** This suggests that the `MEDIA` class can be associated with multiple other types of models (classes) through a single set of association fields in the `MEDIA` table. Instead of having separate foreign keys for each possible parent model (e.g., `user_id`, `post_id`), a polymorphic relationship typically uses two columns:
    *   `model_type`: Stores the class name of the parent model (e.g., 'App\Models\User', 'App\Models\Post').
    *   `model_id`: Stores the ID of the parent model instance.
    The `MEDIA` class in the diagram has these: `+string model_type <<IDX>>` and `+bigint model_id <<IDX>>`.

b.  **Attributes in `MEDIA` class:**
    *   `+string model_type`
    *   `+bigint model_id`
    (Others include `id`, `uuid`, `collection_name`. The comment "' ... other Spatie Media attributes ...'" implies it's based on a common Laravel package, which would include many more like `name`, `file_name`, `mime_type`, `disk`, `size`, etc.)

c.  **Why use polymorphic relationships for media assets?**
    *   **Flexibility & Reusability:** You can attach media (images, videos, documents) to many different kinds of records (users for avatars, posts for featured images or attachments, products for product images, etc.) without needing to add a specific foreign key to the `MEDIA` table for each new type of record that might need media.
    *   **Centralized Media Management:** All media files are managed in one table (`MEDIA`), making it easier to handle storage, retrieval, and deletion of media assets consistently across the application.
    *   **Reduced Schema Complexity:** Avoids cluttering the `MEDIA` table with numerous nullable foreign key columns (e.g., `user_id`, `post_id`, `product_id`, etc.), most of which would be `NULL` for any given media record.
    *   **Extensibility:** If you introduce a new model that needs to have media associated with it, you don't need to alter the `MEDIA` table's schema. You just start using the new model's type and ID in the polymorphic relationship.
