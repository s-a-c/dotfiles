## 1.1. Introduction

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #add8e6; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #005a9c;">Welcome!</h4>
<p style="color: #333;">This interactive tutorial will guide you through understanding the E_L_A Product Requirements Document (PRD) Class Diagram. By the end, you'll be able to interpret its key components and relationships.</p>
</div>

### 1.1.1. Learning Objectives

Upon completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Identify the main purpose of the PRD Class Diagram.
- Recognize common class diagram notations used.
- Understand the key classes and their attributes/methods depicted.
- Interpret the relationships (e.g., association, aggregation) between classes.

### 1.1.2. Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of what a Product Requirements Document (PRD) is.
- Familiarity with the E_L_A documentation suite is helpful but not strictly required.
- Access to the E_L_A PRD Class Diagram file (e.g., `010-010-ela-prd-class.plantuml`).

### 1.1.3. Estimated Time

- **Tutorial:** 30-45 minutes
- **Exercises:** 15-20 minutes

## 1.2. Step-by-Step Guidance

Let's break down how to approach and understand the PRD Class Diagram.

### 1.2.1. What is a Class Diagram? (Brief Overview)

*(Content to be added: A short explanation of class diagrams in software engineering and their purpose.)*

<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
ðŸ’¡ **Quick Tip:** Class diagrams are like blueprints for software systems, showing the structure and relationships of different components (classes).
</div>

### 1.2.2. Locating the E_L_A PRD Class Diagram

The E_L_A PRD Class Diagram is located at:
`docs/E_L_A/010-010-ela-prd-class.plantuml`

*(Consider embedding a view of the diagram here or a prominent link if direct embedding is complex for the pilot.)*

### 1.2.3. Key Elements in the Diagram

*(Content to be added: Identify and explain 2-3 major classes from the diagram as examples. Discuss attributes and methods.)*

#### Example Class: `[ClassNameFromDiagram]`
- **Attributes:** `[Attribute1]`, `[Attribute2]`
- **Methods:** `[Method1()]`, `[Method2()]`

### 1.2.4. Understanding Relationships

*(Content to be added: Explain common relationship types found in the diagram, e.g., association, inheritance, aggregation, composition, with examples from the PRD class diagram.)*

## 1.3. Interactive Elements

### 1.3.1. Element Explorer (Placeholder)

*(Placeholder for a future interactive element, e.g., clicking parts of an embedded diagram to get more information.)*

<div style="background-color: #fffacd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
âœ¨ **Interactive Idea:** Imagine clicking on a class in the diagram below to see its description and relationships highlight! (For the pilot, we'll describe this manually).
</div>

---

## 1.4. Revision Summary

- Class diagrams visually represent the static structure of a system.
- The E_L_A PRD Class Diagram shows the key entities involved in the product requirements.
- Key components include classes (with attributes and methods) and relationships between them.
*(More points to be added as content is developed)*

## 1.5. Exercises

Here are a few exercises to test your understanding. Please attempt them before looking at the answers.

1.  **Exercise 1:** Identify three main classes in the PRD Class Diagram and list one attribute for each.
2.  **Exercise 2:** Find an example of an association relationship in the diagram. Describe the classes involved and the nature of their association.
3.  **Exercise 3:** What is the purpose of the `[SpecificClassFromDiagram]` class?
4.  **Exercise 4:** *(To be defined)*
5.  **Exercise 5:** *(To be defined)*

<div style="padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;">
ðŸ”— **Answers:** You can find the sample answers for these exercises in the companion document:
<a href="./070-understanding-the-prd-class-diagram-answers.md">070-understanding-the-prd-class-diagram-answers.md</a>
</div>

## 1.6. Assessment/Checks

*(Placeholder for short quizzes or checks, e.g., multiple-choice questions based on the tutorial content.)*

**Quick Check:**
1. What does UML stand for?
   (a) Universal Modeling Language
   (b) Unified Modeling Language
   (c) Unique Model Language

*(Answer will be provided in a collapsible section or similar for self-check)*

## 1.7. Overall Summary & Next Steps

Congratulations on completing this tutorial on the E_L_A PRD Class Diagram! You should now have a better understanding of its structure and how to interpret it.

**Next Steps:**
- Review the `[010-000-ela-prd.md](./010-000-ela-prd.md)` document for more context on the product requirements.
- Explore other diagrams in the `docs/E_L_A/` directory.
