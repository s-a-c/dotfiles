### 3.1.1. Learning Objectives

Upon completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Identify the key features for creating and managing posts in ELA.
- Understand the role of categories in content organization.
- Describe which user roles are responsible for managing posts and categories.
- Explain the basic content submission workflow for a "Contributor."

### 3.1.3. Scenario

Imagine you are an **Editor** in the ELA system. A new marketing campaign is launching, and several team members (Authors and Contributors) will be creating blog posts. Your task is to ensure all content is correctly created, categorized under a new "Marketing Campaign Q3" category, and published according to the ELA workflow. This tutorial will equip you with the foundational knowledge.

## 3.2. Understanding Posts in ELA

Posts are the lifeblood of dynamic content in ELA. This section delves into how they are created and managed.

### 3.2.1. Exercise 1: Key Features of Post Creation

**Task:** Based on the ELA PRD (Section 3.2.1 "Content Creation & Management"), list three primary features ELA offers to users when they are creating or editing a post.

<div style="background-color: #fffacd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ffd700; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #b8860b;">Your Answer:</h5>
  <textarea rows="4" style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;" placeholder="List three features here..."></textarea>
</div>

### 3.2.2. Solution & Explanation

<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #90ee90; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  1.  **WYSIWYG Editor:** Allows for rich text formatting and an intuitive content creation experience.
  2.  **Version History:** Tracks changes to posts, enabling users to revert to previous versions if needed.
  3.  **Scheduling:** Provides the ability to schedule posts for future publication.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> These features empower users with robust tools for crafting, managing, and timing their content effectively, ensuring both quality and flexibility.</p>

## 3.3. Organizing Content with Categories

Categories are essential for structuring content and improving discoverability. Let's explore their management.

### 3.3.1. Exercise 2: Managing and Assigning Categories

**Task:** An "Author" user has written a new blog post. According to the ELA PRD (Sections 3.2.2 "Categorization & Tagging" and 3.2.6 "User Roles and Permissions"):
1.  Which user role(s) can create a new category (e.g., "Product Updates")?
2.  Can the "Author" assign their post to an *existing* category?

<div style="background-color: #fffacd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ffd700; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #b8860b;">Your Answer:</h5>
  <textarea rows="5" style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;" placeholder="Answer both parts of the question here..."></textarea>
</div>

### 3.3.2. Solution & Explanation

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #90ee90; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  1.  **"Administrator"** and **"Editor"** roles can manage categories, which includes creating new ones.
  2.  Yes, an **"Author"** can typically assign their posts to existing categories. The PRD states Editors manage categories, implying creation and structural changes, while Authors focus on their content and its placement within the existing structure.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This division of responsibility ensures that the overall content taxonomy is maintained by users with broader editorial oversight (Administrators, Editors), while content creators (Authors) can still organize their work within the established framework.</p>

## 3.4. Content Workflow: The Contributor Role

ELA supports different user roles, including "Contributors" who have a specific content submission workflow.

### 3.4.1. Exercise 3: A Contributor's Submission Process

**Task:** A "Contributor" user has just finished writing an insightful article. According to the ELA PRD (Section 3.2.6 "User Roles and Permissions"), what is the immediate next step for their article? Can they publish it themselves?

<div style="background-color: #fffacd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ffd700; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #b8860b;">Your Answer:</h5>
  <textarea rows="4" style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;" placeholder="Describe the Contributor's next step and publishing ability..."></textarea>
</div>

### 3.4.2. Solution & Explanation

<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #90ee90; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A "Contributor" cannot publish the article themselves. The immediate next step is to **submit the post for review**. An "Editor" or "Administrator" will then need to review and approve/publish the article.</p>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This workflow is crucial for quality assurance and editorial control, ensuring that content submitted by Contributors meets the required standards before it goes live. It's a common practice in many content management systems to maintain content quality.</p>
