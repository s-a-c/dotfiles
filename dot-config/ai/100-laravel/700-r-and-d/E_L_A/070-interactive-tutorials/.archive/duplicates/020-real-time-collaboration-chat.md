- Understand how chat works within teams and channels.
- Describe how notifications and user presence indicators function.
- Recognize the benefits of integrated real-time communication.

### 4.1.2. Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ELA and its team structures (refer to [005-ela-executive-summary.md](../../005-ela-executive-summary.md) and [010-000-ela-prd.md](../../010-000-ela-prd.md), particularly sections on Teams).

### 4.1.3. Scenario

Imagine you are a **Team Member** in the "Alpha Project" team within ELA. Your team is working on a tight deadline. You need to quickly ask your Team Lead a question about a task, share an important update with the entire team, and see if a colleague from another department is online for a quick consultation. This tutorial will show you how ELA Chat facilitates these interactions.

## 4.2. ELA Chat Fundamentals

Let's start with the basics of what ELA Chat offers.

### 4.2.1. Exercise 1: Core Chat Features

**Task:** Based on the ELA PRD (Section 3.2.4 "Real-time Communication"), list three core functionalities provided by the ELA chat system for users.

  <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  1.  **Direct Messaging:** Allows users to have one-on-one private conversations.
  2.  **Team/Group Channels:** Facilitates discussions within specific teams or project groups.
  3.  **File Sharing:** Enables users to share documents and other files directly within chat conversations.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> These features form the backbone of ELA's chat system, providing versatile communication options for individual and group collaboration, along with the practical ability to exchange necessary files seamlessly.</p>

## 4.3. Chatting in Teams and Channels

ELA chat is tightly integrated with its team structure.

### 4.3.1. Exercise 2: Team Communication Dynamics

**Task:** According to the ELA PRD (Section 3.1.2 "Team Structure & Roles" and 3.2.4 "Real-time Communication"):
1.  When a new team is created in ELA, is a dedicated chat channel automatically provisioned for that team?
2.  Can users be part of multiple team chat channels simultaneously?

<div style="background-color: #fffbe6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ffe58f; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #d48806;">Your Answer:</h5>
  <textarea rows="5" style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;" placeholder="Answer both parts of the question here..."></textarea>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f6ffed; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #b7eb8f; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  1.  Yes, the PRD implies that team creation includes associated communication channels: "Each team will have a dedicated space... including chat channels." (derived from intent of 3.1.2 and 3.2.4).
  2.  Yes, users can be members of multiple teams, and therefore would have access to the chat channels of all teams they belong to.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This structure ensures that communication is organized and relevant to team activities. Automatic channel creation streamlines setup, and multi-channel access allows users to stay connected across various projects and responsibilities.</p>

## 4.4. Notifications and User Presence

Knowing who's available and getting timely updates is crucial for real-time collaboration.

### 4.4.1. Exercise 3: Staying Informed

**Task:** Based on the ELA PRD (Section 3.2.4 "Real-time Communication"):
1.  How does ELA inform users of new chat messages?
2.  What feature helps users determine if a colleague is currently active in ELA?

<div style="background-color: #fffbe6; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #ffe58f; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h5 style="margin-top: 0; color: #d48806;">Your Answer:</h5>
  <textarea rows="4" style="width: 100%; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;" placeholder="Describe notification methods and presence indication..."></textarea>
</div>

### 4.4.2. Solution & Explanation

<summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
<div style="background-color: #f6ffed; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid #b7eb8f; margin-top: 10px;">
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  1.  ELA uses **real-time notifications** (e.g., visual cues, possibly sound alerts â€“ though specific alert types might be user-configurable) to inform users of new messages.
  2.  **User presence indicators** (e.g., online, offline, away statuses) help users see if colleagues are active.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Notifications ensure that users don't miss important messages, fostering prompt responses. Presence indicators help users gauge the best time to initiate a conversation, respecting colleagues' availability and improving communication efficiency.</p>
