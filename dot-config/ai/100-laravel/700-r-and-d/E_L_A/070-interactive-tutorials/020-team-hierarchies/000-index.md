## 1. Introduction

This directory contains interactive tutorials focused on team hierarchies and permissions in the Enhanced Laravel Application (ELA). Teams are a cornerstone of collaboration in ELA, providing a structured way to organize users, scope data, and manage permissions.

Team hierarchies in ELA allow for parent-child relationships between teams, creating a tree-like structure that can represent organizational departments, project groups, or any logical collection of users working towards common goals. Understanding how to navigate and manage these hierarchies is essential for effective administration of an ELA instance.
