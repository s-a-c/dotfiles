## Event Sourcing Concept

### What is Event Sourcing?

Event sourcing is a pattern where changes to the application state are captured as a sequence of events. Instead of
storing the current state of an entity, event sourcing stores the history of events that led to that state. The current
state can be reconstructed by replaying the events.

Key characteristics of event sourcing:

1. **Events as First-Class Citizens**: Events are the primary source of truth
2. **Immutable Events**: Events are immutable and never modified
3. **Event Store**: Events are stored in an event store
4. **Event Replay**: Events can be replayed to reconstruct state
5. **Temporal Queries**: Historical state can be queried

### Core Principles

Event sourcing is based on several core principles:

1. **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate write and read models
2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Focus on the domain model
3. **Aggregate Roots**: Entities that ensure consistency boundaries
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Events drive the system
5. **Eventual Consistency**: Read models are eventually consistent with the event store

### Key Components

The event sourcing implementation consists of several key components:

1. **Aggregates**: Entities that ensure consistency boundaries
2. **Events**: Immutable records of state changes
3. **Event Store**: Storage for events
4. **Projectors**: Build read models from events
5. **Reactors**: Perform side effects in response to events
6. **Queries**: Retrieve data from read models

## Implementation Strategy

### Package Selection

The event sourcing implementation uses the following packages:

1. **spatie/laravel-event-sourcing**: Core event sourcing functionality
2. **hirethunk/verbs**: Command and query handling
3. **spatie/laravel-model-states**: State machines for aggregates
4. **spatie/laravel-permission**: Role-based access control
5. **spatie/laravel-comments**: Comments and reactions
6. **laravel/reverb**: Real-time functionality

### Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into several phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Set up base infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Implement aggregates and events
3. **Phase 3**: Implement projectors and read models
4. **Phase 4**: Implement reactors and side effects
5. **Phase 5**: Implement queries and API endpoints
6. **Phase 6**: Implement testing and validation
7. **Phase 7**: Integrate with other components

### Integration Points

The event sourcing implementation integrates with several other components:

1. **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization
2. **API**: RESTful API endpoints
3. **Frontend**: User interface
4. **Notifications**: Email and push notifications
5. **Real-time**: WebSocket communication

### Command Layer

The command layer is responsible for handling commands and updating aggregates:

1. **Commands**: Represent user intentions
2. **Command Handlers**: Process commands and update aggregates
3. **Command Bus**: Routes commands to handlers

### Event Layer

The event layer is responsible for storing and dispatching events:

1. **Events**: Represent state changes
2. **Event Store**: Stores events
3. **Event Bus**: Dispatches events to projectors and reactors

### Projection Layer

The projection layer is responsible for building read models:

1. **Projectors**: Build read models from events
2. **Read Models**: Optimized for specific queries
3. **Projection Reset**: Rebuild read models from events

### Query Layer

The query layer is responsible for retrieving data:

1. **Queries**: Represent data retrieval requests
2. **Query Handlers**: Process queries and return data
3. **Query Bus**: Routes queries to handlers
