## Upgrade Considerations

When upgrading packages, consider the following:

2. **PHP Version**: Upgrading PHP may require updates to code syntax and package compatibility. Test thoroughly before deployment.

3. **Filament Admin**: Filament updates may require theme adjustments and plugin compatibility checks.

4. **Livewire/Volt**: Component syntax and behavior may change between versions. Test all components after upgrading.

5. **Database Drivers**: PostgreSQL driver updates may affect schema configuration and query behavior.

## Version Update Process

Follow this process when updating package versions:

1. **Research**: Review release notes and breaking changes for the packages being updated.

2. **Local Testing**: Update packages in a development environment first:
   ```bash
   composer update package/name --with-dependencies
   ```

3. **Run Tests**: Execute the full test suite to identify any issues:
   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

4. **Fix Issues**: Address any compatibility issues or breaking changes.

5. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment for further testing.

6. **Update Documentation**: Update this compatibility matrix with new version information.

7. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production after thorough testing.

8. **Monitor**: Watch for any unexpected behavior after the update.
