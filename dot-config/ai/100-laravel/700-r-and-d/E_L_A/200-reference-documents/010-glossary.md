## Overview

This glossary provides definitions for technical terms, acronyms, and project-specific terminology used throughout the
Enhanced Laravel Application documentation. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

## A

<details>
<summary><strong>Adjacency List</strong></summary>

A data structure used to represent hierarchical relationships in a database. In the ELA, adjacency lists are used for
implementing hierarchical teams, categories, and todos. The implementation uses the `staudenmeir/laravel-adjacency-list`
package.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Aggregate (Event Sourcing)</strong></summary>

In the context of event sourcing, an aggregate is a domain object that handles commands, applies business rules, and
emits events. Aggregates are responsible for maintaining their own state and enforcing invariants.

The ELA implements aggregates using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides an `AggregateRoot` base
class for creating aggregates.

**Example Aggregate:**

````php
// TodoAggregate.php
namespace App\Aggregates;

use App\Events\TodoCreated;
use App\Events\TodoCompleted;
use Spatie\EventSourcing\AggregateRoots\AggregateRoot;

class TodoAggregate extends AggregateRoot
{
    public function createTodo(string $title, string $description, int $userId): self
    {
        $this->recordThat(new TodoCreated([
            'title' => $title,
            'description' => $description,
            'user_id' => $userId,
        ]));

        return $this;
    }

    public function completeTodo(): self
    {
        $this->recordThat(new TodoCompleted([
            'completed_at' => now(),
        ]));

        return $this;
    }
}

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Alpine.js</strong></summary>

A minimal JavaScript framework for adding interactivity to web pages. Alpine.js is used in the ELA for frontend interactivity, particularly in conjunction with Livewire components.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong></summary>

A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. The ELA provides RESTful APIs for integration with other systems.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Artisan</strong></summary>

The command-line interface included with Laravel. Artisan provides a number of helpful commands for development and maintenance tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authentication</strong></summary>

The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. The ELA uses Laravel Fortify for authentication, including multi-factor authentication.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authorization</strong></summary>

The process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to perform a specific action. The ELA uses Spatie's Laravel Permission package for role-based access control.
</details>

## B

<details>
<summary><strong>Blade</strong></summary>

Laravel's templating engine that allows you to use PHP code in your views. Blade templates are used throughout the ELA for rendering HTML.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Broadcasting</strong></summary>

The process of sending server-side events to client-side applications in real-time. The ELA uses Laravel Reverb for WebSocket broadcasting.
</details>

## C

<details>
<summary><strong>Cache</strong></summary>

A temporary storage area that stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval. The ELA uses Redis for caching to improve performance.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Category</strong></summary>

A core entity in the ELA that allows for the organization of content. Categories can be hierarchical and are associated with teams.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)</strong></summary>

A software development practice where code changes are automatically tested and deployed to production. The ELA uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Command</strong></summary>

In the context of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), a command is an operation that changes the state of the system. The ELA uses the `hirethunk/verbs` package for implementing commands.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Command (Event Sourcing)</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, a command is an instruction to perform an action that will change the state of an aggregate. Commands are handled by command handlers, which apply business rules and, if valid, record events to the event store.

The ELA implements commands using the `hirethunk/verbs` package, which provides a structured way to define and handle commands.

**Example Command:**

```php
// CreateTodoCommand.php
namespace App\Commands;

use Hirethunk\Verbs\Command;

class CreateTodoCommand extends Command
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $description,
        public int $userId
    ) {}
}
```php
**Example Command Handler:**

```php
// CreateTodoCommandHandler.php
namespace App\CommandHandlers;

use App\Aggregates\TodoAggregate;
use App\Commands\CreateTodoCommand;
use Hirethunk\Verbs\CommandHandler;

class CreateTodoCommandHandler extends CommandHandler
{
    public function handle(CreateTodoCommand $command)
    {
        $aggregateUuid = (string) Str::uuid();

        TodoAggregate::retrieve($aggregateUuid)
            ->createTodo(
                $command->title,
                $command->description,
                $command->userId
            )
            ->persist();

        return $aggregateUuid;
    }
}

<details>
<summary><strong>Composer</strong></summary>

A dependency manager for PHP that allows you to declare and manage the libraries your project depends on. The ELA uses Composer for managing PHP dependencies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</strong></summary>

A design pattern that separates read and write operations into different models:

- **Commands**: Operations that change the state of the system (create, update, delete)
- **Queries**: Operations that retrieve data without changing state (read)

Benefits of CQRS include:

- Improved scalability by optimizing read and write operations separately
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced security by applying different authorization rules to commands and queries
- Simplified domain models

The ELA implements CQRS using the `hirethunk/verbs` package, which provides base classes for commands and queries.

**Example Command:**

```php
// CreatePostCommand.php
namespace App\Commands;

use HireThunk\Verbs\Command;

class CreatePostCommand extends Command
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $content,
        public int $authorId
    ) {}
}
```php
**Example Query:**

```php
// GetPostByIdQuery.php
namespace App\Queries;

use HireThunk\Verbs\Query;

class GetPostByIdQuery extends Query
{
    public function __construct(
        public int $postId
    ) {}
}
```text

<details>
<summary><strong>Domain Event</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, a domain event is an immutable record of something that happened in the domain. Domain events represent facts that have occurred and cannot be changed or undone. They are the building blocks of an event-sourced system and are stored in the event store.

The ELA implements domain events using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides a `ShouldBeStored` interface for creating domain events.

**Example Domain Event:**

```php
// TodoCreated.php
namespace App\Events;

use Spatie\EventSourcing\StoredEvents\ShouldBeStored;

class TodoCreated implements ShouldBeStored
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $description,
        public int $userId,
        public string $createdAt
    ) {}
}
```php
Domain events have several important characteristics:

- They are named in the past tense (e.g., `TodoCreated`, `UserRegistered`)
- They are immutable and should not be modified once created
- They contain all the data needed to understand what happened
- They are stored in chronological order in the event store
- They can be replayed to reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time

</details>

## D

<details>
<summary><strong>Database Migration</strong></summary>

A version control system for your database schema. Migrations allow you to modify your database schema over time in a consistent and repeatable way.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Dependency Injection</strong></summary>

A design pattern where objects receive other objects that they depend on. Laravel's service container provides automatic dependency injection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deployment</strong></summary>

The process of making a software application available for use. The ELA provides deployment guides for various environments.
</details>

## E

<details>
<summary><strong>Eloquent</strong></summary>

Laravel's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that provides an elegant, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Environment Variables</strong></summary>

Variables that are set outside the application and can affect how the application runs. In Laravel, environment variables are typically stored in a `.env` file.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Event</strong></summary>

A way to decouple various aspects of your application. The ELA uses Laravel's event system for logging activities and triggering actions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Event Sourcing</strong></summary>

A design pattern where all changes to an application's state are stored as a sequence of events. Instead of storing the current state, the application reconstructs the state by replaying the events.

Benefits of Event Sourcing include:

- Complete audit trail and history of all changes
- Ability to reconstruct the state at any point in time (temporal queries)
- Improved debugging and troubleshooting
- Enhanced system resilience and recovery
- Natural fit for CQRS and domain-driven design
- Advanced business analytics based on event streams

The ELA implements Event Sourcing using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides tools for working with event streams and projections.

**Key Components of Event Sourcing:**

1. **Domain Events**: Immutable records of something that happened in the domain
2. **Event Store**: Persistent storage for all events
3. **Aggregates**: Domain objects that handle commands and apply events
4. **Projectors**: Build and maintain read models based on events
5. **Reactors**: Execute side effects when specific events occur
6. **Snapshots**: Point-in-time captures of aggregate state for performance optimization

**Example Event:**

```php
// PostCreatedEvent.php
namespace App\Events;

use Spatie\EventSourcing\StoredEvents\ShouldBeStored;

class PostCreatedEvent implements ShouldBeStored
{
    public function __construct(
        public int $postId,
        public string $title,
        public string $content,
        public int $authorId,
        public string $createdAt
    ) {}
}
```text

**Example Aggregate:**

```php
// PostAggregate.php
namespace App\Aggregates;

use App\Events\PostCreatedEvent;
use Spatie\EventSourcing\AggregateRoots\AggregateRoot;

class PostAggregate extends AggregateRoot
{
    public function createPost(string $title, string $content, int $authorId): self
    {
        $this->recordThat(new PostCreatedEvent(
            $this->uuid(),
            $title,
            $content,
            $authorId,
            now()->toDateTimeString()
        ));

        return $this;
    }
}
```php

<details>
<summary><strong>Event Schema Evolution</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, event schema evolution refers to the process of managing changes to the structure of domain events over time. Since events are immutable and stored permanently, changes to event schemas must be handled carefully to ensure backward compatibility and system resilience.

The ELA implements a strategy for managing event schema evolution that includes:

- **Versioned Events**: New event versions are created when the schema changes (e.g., `TodoCreatedV1`, `TodoCreatedV2`)
- **Upconverting Events**: Older event versions are upconverted to the latest version when retrieved
- **Backward Compatibility**: Projectors and reactors handle both old and new event versions
- **Migration Strategy**: When significant schema changes are needed, a migration strategy is implemented to convert old events to new formats

**Example Upconverter:**

```php
// TodoCreatedUpconverter.php
namespace App\EventUpconverters;

use Spatie\EventSourcing\EventSerializers\EventSerializer;
use Spatie\EventSourcing\StoredEvents\ShouldBeStored;

class TodoCreatedUpconverter implements EventUpconverter
{
    public function canUpconvert(string $eventClass, array $properties): bool
    {
        return $eventClass === 'App\\Events\\TodoCreatedV1';
    }

    public function upconvert(string $eventClass, array $properties): ShouldBeStored
    {
        return new TodoCreatedV2(
            $properties['title'],
            $properties['description'],
            $properties['userId'],
            $properties['createdAt'],
            // New property in V2
            $properties['priority'] ?? 'medium'
        );
    }
}
```text

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Event Store</strong></summary>

A specialized database that stores events as part of an event sourcing architecture. The event store is the source of truth for the entire application, containing a complete history of all domain events.

Key characteristics of an event store:

- Events are immutable and never deleted or modified
- Events are stored in chronological order
- Events can be replayed to reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time
- Events are typically stored with metadata such as timestamp, aggregate ID, and version

The ELA implements the event store using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides a database-backed event store implementation.

**Example Event Store Configuration:**

```php
// config/event-sourcing.php
return [
    'database' => [
        'connection' => env('EVENT_SOURCING_DB_CONNECTION', env('DB_CONNECTION', 'pgsql')),
        'table_name' => 'stored_events',
    ],
    'stored_event_model' => Spatie\EventSourcing\StoredEvents\Models\EloquentStoredEvent::class,
    // Other configuration options...
];
```php

- [Technical Architecture Document - Event Store Section](../030-ela-tad.md#event-store)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Event Stream</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, an event stream is a sequence of events for a specific aggregate, ordered chronologically. Event streams are the primary data structure in event sourcing and represent the complete history of changes to an aggregate.

Key characteristics of an event stream:

- Events are ordered chronologically
- Each event in the stream represents a state change
- The stream can be replayed to reconstruct the current state of the aggregate
- Multiple streams can be combined for analytics and reporting

The ELA implements event streams using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides methods for retrieving and processing event streams.

**Example Event Stream Usage:**

```php
// Retrieve an event stream for a specific aggregate
$events = StoredEvent::query()
    ->uuid($aggregateUuid)
    ->orderBy('created_at')
    ->get();

// Process the event stream
foreach ($events as $event) {
    // Handle each event
    $this->handleEvent($event);
}

Benefits of Livewire Flux include:

- Centralized state management
- Predictable state changes
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Better component organization

The ELA uses Livewire Flux for managing complex UI states, particularly in the admin panel and user dashboard.

**Example Flux Store:**

```php
// TodoStore.php
namespace App\Flux\Stores;

use Livewire\Flux\Store;
use App\Models\Todo;

class TodoStore extends Store
{
    public function state(): array
    {
        return [
            'todos' => [],
            'filter' => 'all',
            'loading' => false,
            'error' => null,
        ];
    }

    public function fetchTodos()
    {
        $this->set('loading', true);

        try {
            $todos = Todo::query()
                ->when($this->get('filter') === 'active', fn($q) => $q->whereNotCompleted())
                ->when($this->get('filter') === 'completed', fn($q) => $q->whereCompleted())
                ->get();

            $this->set('todos', $todos);
            $this->set('error', null);
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            $this->set('error', $e->getMessage());
        } finally {
            $this->set('loading', false);
        }
    }

    public function setFilter(string $filter)
    {
        $this->set('filter', $filter);
        $this->fetchTodos();
    }
}
```php
**Example Usage in a Component:**

```php
// TodoList.php
namespace App\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;
use Livewire\Flux\WithFlux;
use App\Flux\Stores\TodoStore;

class TodoList extends Component
{
    use WithFlux;

    public function mount()
    {
        $this->flux->store(TodoStore::class)->fetchTodos();
    }

    public function filterTodos(string $filter)
    {
        $this->flux->store(TodoStore::class)->setFilter($filter);
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.todo-list', [
            'todos' => $this->flux->state(TodoStore::class, 'todos'),
            'filter' => $this->flux->state(TodoStore::class, 'filter'),
            'loading' => $this->flux->state(TodoStore::class, 'loading'),
            'error' => $this->flux->state(TodoStore::class, 'error'),
        ]);
    }
}

- Better organization of related code

The ELA uses Livewire Volt for building UI components, particularly for simpler components that don't require complex state management.

**Example Volt Component:**

```php
<?php

use function Livewire\Volt\{state, computed, mount};
use App\Models\Todo;

state([
    'todos' => [],
    'newTodo' => '',
]);

mount(function () {
    $this->todos = Todo::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
});

$addTodo = function () {
    Todo::create([
        'title' => $this->newTodo,
        'user_id' => auth()->id(),
    ]);

    $this->todos = Todo::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
    $this->newTodo = '';
};

$toggleCompleted = function (Todo $todo) {
    $todo->update(['completed' => !$todo->completed]);
    $this->todos = Todo::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
};

$deleteTodo = function (Todo $todo) {
    $todo->delete();
    $this->todos = Todo::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
};

computed(function () {
    return count($this->todos);
})->as('todoCount');
?>

<div>
    <h2>My Todo List ({{ $this->todoCount }})</h2>

    <form wire:submit.prevent="addTodo">
        <input type="text" wire:model="newTodo" placeholder="Add a new todo..." />
        <button type="submit">Add</button>
    </form>

    <ul>
        @foreach($todos as $todo)
            <li class="{{ $todo->completed ? 'completed' : '' }}">
                <input type="checkbox"
                       wire:click="toggleCompleted({{ $todo->id }})"
                       {{ $todo->completed ? 'checked' : '' }} />
                {{ $todo->title }}
                <button wire:click="deleteTodo({{ $todo->id }})">Delete</button>
            </li>
        @endforeach
    </ul>
</div>

<summary><strong>Projector (Event Sourcing)</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, a projector is a class that builds and maintains read models based on events. Projectors listen for specific events and update the read models accordingly, transforming the event stream into a format optimized for querying.

The ELA implements projectors using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides a `Projector` base class for creating projectors.

**Example Projector:**

```php
// TodoProjector.php
namespace App\Projectors;

use App\Events\TodoCreated;
use App\Events\TodoCompleted;
use App\Models\Todo;
use Spatie\EventSourcing\EventHandlers\Projectors\Projector;

class TodoProjector extends Projector
{
    public function onTodoCreated(TodoCreated $event, string $aggregateUuid)
    {
        Todo::create([
            'id' => $aggregateUuid,
            'title' => $event->title,
            'description' => $event->description,
            'user_id' => $event->userId,
            'status' => 'pending',
        ]);
    }

    public function onTodoCompleted(TodoCompleted $event, string $aggregateUuid)
    {
        $todo = Todo::findOrFail($aggregateUuid);
        $todo->status = 'completed';
        $todo->completed_at = $event->completedAt;
        $todo->save();
    }
}

## Q

<details>
<summary><strong>Query</strong></summary>

In the context of CQRS, a query is an operation that retrieves data without changing the state of the system. The ELA uses the `hirethunk/verbs` package for implementing queries.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Temporal Query (Event Sourcing)</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, a temporal query is a query that retrieves the state of an entity at a specific point in time. Since all changes to the system are stored as a sequence of events, it's possible to reconstruct the state of any entity at any point in its history.

The ELA implements temporal queries using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides methods for retrieving and replaying events up to a specific point in time.

**Example Temporal Query:**

```php
// Get the state of a todo at a specific point in time
public function getTodoStateAt(string $todoId, Carbon $timestamp)
{
    $events = StoredEvent::query()
        ->uuid($todoId)
        ->where('created_at', '<=', $timestamp)
        ->orderBy('created_at')
        ->get();

    $todo = new TodoState();

    foreach ($events as $event) {
        $todo->apply($event);
    }

    return $todo;
}
```php
Temporal queries are useful for:

- Auditing and compliance reporting
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Historical analysis and reporting
- Reconstructing the state of the system at the time of an incident

<details>
<summary><strong>Reactor (Event Sourcing)</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, a reactor is a class that executes side effects when specific events occur. Unlike projectors, which update read models, reactors perform actions such as sending notifications, updating external systems, or triggering other processes.

The ELA implements reactors using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides a `Reactor` base class for creating reactors.

**Example Reactor:**

```php
// TodoNotificationReactor.php
namespace App\Reactors;

use App\Events\TodoAssigned;
use App\Events\TodoCompleted;
use App\Notifications\TodoAssignedNotification;
use App\Notifications\TodoCompletedNotification;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Notification;
use Spatie\EventSourcing\EventHandlers\Reactors\Reactor;

class TodoNotificationReactor extends Reactor
{
    public function onTodoAssigned(TodoAssigned $event, string $aggregateUuid)
    {
        $user = User::findOrFail($event->assignedToUserId);
        $todo = Todo::findOrFail($aggregateUuid);

        Notification::send($user, new TodoAssignedNotification($todo));
    }

    public function onTodoCompleted(TodoCompleted $event, string $aggregateUuid)
    {
        $todo = Todo::findOrFail($aggregateUuid);
        $creator = User::findOrFail($todo->created_by);

        Notification::send($creator, new TodoCompletedNotification($todo));
    }
}

<details>
<summary><strong>Snapshot (Event Sourcing)</strong></summary>

In event sourcing, a snapshot is a point-in-time capture of an aggregate's state. Snapshots are used to optimize performance by reducing the number of events that need to be replayed when reconstructing an aggregate's state.

The ELA implements snapshots using the `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` package, which provides built-in support for creating and using snapshots.

**Example Snapshot Configuration:**

```php
// config/event-sourcing.php
return [
    // Other configuration options...
    'snapshots' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'repository' => Spatie\EventSourcing\Snapshots\EloquentSnapshotRepository::class,
        'threshold' => 50, // Create a snapshot every 50 events
    ],
];
```php

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>State Machine</strong></summary>

A design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. State machines define a finite set of states and the transitions between them, ensuring that objects can only transition between valid states.

Benefits of State Machines include:

- Clear definition of possible states and transitions
- Prevention of invalid state transitions
- Simplified business logic
- Improved code organization

The ELA uses Spatie's Laravel Model States package for implementing state machines, which provides a clean way to define states and transitions for Laravel models.

**Example State Machine:**

```php
// TodoState.php
namespace App\States\Todo;

use App\Models\Todo;
use Spatie\ModelStates\State;
use Spatie\ModelStates\StateConfig;

abstract class TodoState extends State
{
    public static function config(): StateConfig
    {
        return parent::config()
            ->allowTransition(Draft::class, InProgress::class)
            ->allowTransition(InProgress::class, Completed::class)
            ->allowTransition(InProgress::class, OnHold::class)
            ->allowTransition(OnHold::class, InProgress::class)
            ->allowTransition(Completed::class, InProgress::class);
    }
}
```text

**Example State Classes:**

```php
// Draft.php
namespace App\States\Todo;

class Draft extends TodoState
{
    public static $name = 'draft';
}

// InProgress.php
namespace App\States\Todo;

class InProgress extends TodoState
{
    public static $name = 'in_progress';
}
```php
**Example Usage:**

```php
// In a controller or service
$todo = Todo::find($id);

// Check current state
if ($todo->state instanceof Draft) {
    // Start working on the todo
    $todo->state->transition(InProgress::class);
}
