## 1. Overview

Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern that stores all changes to an application state as a sequence of events. This document provides a concise summary of event sourcing concepts, benefits, and challenges.


## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1. Events

Events are immutable facts that describe something that happened in the past. They are the primary building blocks of an event-sourced system.

### 2.2. Event Store

The event store is a specialized database that stores events in the order they were created. It provides an append-only log of all events.

### 2.3. Aggregates

Aggregates are domain objects that encapsulate business rules and ensure consistency. They emit events when their state changes.

### 2.4. Projections

Projections transform events into optimized read models for specific use cases. They allow for efficient querying of the application state.


## 3. Benefits

### 3.1. Complete Audit Trail

Event sourcing provides a complete history of all changes to the application state, making it ideal for systems where audit trails are important.

### 3.2. Temporal Querying

With event sourcing, you can determine the state of the application at any point in time by replaying events up to that point.

### 3.3. Debugging Capabilities

Event sourcing makes debugging easier by allowing developers to replay events to reproduce issues.

### 3.4. Separation of Concerns

Event sourcing naturally separates write and read concerns, allowing for optimized read models.


## 4. Challenges

### 4.1. Learning Curve

Event sourcing requires a different mindset and approach compared to traditional CRUD applications.

### 4.2. Eventual Consistency

Projections are eventually consistent, which may require additional handling in the UI.

### 4.3. Schema Evolution

Changing event schemas can be challenging and requires careful planning.

### 4.4. Performance Considerations

For aggregates with many events, performance can be a concern without proper optimization techniques like snapshots.
