       - Service-based architecture for business logic
       - Event-driven architecture for system events

   1.2. Infrastructure Layer
       - Docker containerization
       - Multi-database support (MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
       - Redis for caching and queues
       - Laravel Octane for performance optimization

2. Core Components

       - Customer management integration

   2.2. Payment Processing System
       - Cashier integration for subscription handling
       - LemonSqueezy integration for payments
       - Transaction logging and management

   2.3. Monitoring System
       - Laravel Telescope for debugging and monitoring
       - Laravel Horizon for queue monitoring
       - Health checks system
       - Pulse for real-time metrics

   2.4. Data Management System
       - Eloquent ORM for database interactions
       - Media Library for file management
       - Import/Export system
       - Comment system implementation

3. Database Architecture

       - transactions

   3.2. Monitoring Tables
       - activity_log
       - health_check_results
       - telescope_entries
       - pulse_entries

   3.3. Feature Tables
       - media
       - comments
       - features (feature flags)
       - imports/exports

4. Integration Architecture
   4.1. External Services
       - Payment processing services
       - Monitoring services
       - Backup services

   4.2. Internal Services
       - Queue workers
       - Scheduled tasks
       - WebSocket servers
       - Cache servers

5. Security Architecture
