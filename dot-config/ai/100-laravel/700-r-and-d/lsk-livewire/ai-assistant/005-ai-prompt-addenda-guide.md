# AI Prompt Addenda Guide

## 1. Introduction

AI Prompt Addenda (AIPA) is a system for customizing the behavior of AI assistants when working with your codebase. It allows you to provide additional instructions that extend the standard prompt, tailoring the assistant's responses to your specific needs and preferences.

## 2. What are AI Prompt Addenda?

AI Prompt Addenda are custom instructions that are automatically appended to the standard prompt when an AI assistant interacts with your codebase. These instructions can include:

- Project-specific conventions and standards
- Architectural guidelines
- Communication preferences
- Framework-specific best practices
- Testing requirements
- And more

By using AI Prompt Addenda, you can ensure that AI assistants provide consistent, high-quality assistance that aligns with your project's requirements and your personal preferences.

## 3. How It Works

The AI Prompt Addenda system works by:

1. Searching for `ai-prompt-addenda.md` files in multiple locations
2. Consolidating the active addenda from all files according to priority rules
3. Applying the consolidated addenda to the AI assistant's prompt

This approach allows for different levels of customization:

- Project-level addenda (highest priority)
- Parent directory addenda (medium priority)
- User's home directory addenda (lowest priority)

## 4. File Structure

AI Prompt Addenda files are Markdown files with a specific structure:

```markdown
# AI Prompt Addenda

This file contains additional instructions that extend the standard prompt for AI Assistants.

## Custom Instructions

Add your custom instructions below. These will be appended to the standard prompt and will guide the assistant's behavior.

```
# Your custom instructions here
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep instructions clear and concise
2. Use markdown formatting for better readability
3. Group related instructions together
4. Use examples when helpful
5. Update this file whenever you need to modify the assistant's behavior

## Example Addenda

```
# Project-Specific Conventions
- Always use snake_case for variable names in PHP files
- Follow the repository's existing code style for new code
- When creating new classes, place them in the appropriate namespace based on their functionality
- Add PHPDoc comments to all public methods

# Communication Preferences
- Be concise in explanations
- Provide code examples when explaining concepts
- When suggesting multiple approaches, clearly indicate the recommended one
- Always explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions
```

## Active Addenda

The following custom instructions are currently active:

```
# Add your active custom instructions here
```
```

The most important section is the "Active Addenda" section, which contains the instructions that will be applied to the AI assistant's prompt.

## 5. Command-Line Tool

The AI Prompt Addenda system includes a command-line tool for managing addenda files:

```bash
bin/aipa
```

This tool provides the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bin/aipa show` | Show the primary addenda file |
| `bin/aipa active` | Show consolidated active addenda |
| `bin/aipa add` | Add new addenda (opens editor) |
| `bin/aipa add 'text'` | Add specific text as addenda |
| `bin/aipa clear` | Clear active addenda |
| `bin/aipa list` | List all addenda files |
| `bin/aipa validate` | Validate addenda files for issues |
| `bin/aipa docs` | Generate documentation |
| `bin/aipa conditions` | Show detected project conditions |
| `bin/aipa help` | Show help information |

### 5.1. Creating a New Addenda File

To create a new addenda file:

```bash
bin/aipa add
```

This will create a new `.aipa/ai-prompt-addenda.md` file in the current directory if it doesn't exist, and open it in your default editor.

### 5.2. Adding Addenda

To add new addenda to the primary file:

```bash
bin/aipa add
```

This will open your default editor, allowing you to enter your addenda. Alternatively, you can add specific text directly:

```bash
bin/aipa add '# Coding Standards
- Use PSR-12 for all PHP files
- Add type hints to all method parameters'
```

### 5.3. Viewing Active Addenda

To view the consolidated active addenda from all files:

```bash
bin/aipa active
```

### 5.4. Clearing Addenda

To clear the active addenda from the primary file:

```bash
bin/aipa clear
```

## 6. Advanced Features

### 6.1. Section Versioning

You can version sections to ensure that newer versions replace older ones:

```markdown
# Coding Standards (v2.0)
- Use PSR-12 for all PHP files
- Add type hints to all method parameters
```

When multiple files contain sections with the same name but different versions, the highest version will be used.

### 6.2. Conditional Sections

You can create sections that only apply when certain conditions are met:

```markdown
# [Laravel] Database Practices
- Use Eloquent models for database access
- Avoid raw SQL queries
```

This section will only be applied when the project is detected as a Laravel project.

The system automatically detects various conditions based on the project's files and environment:

- Programming languages (PHP, JavaScript, etc.)
- Frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, React, Vue, etc.)
- Environment (development, production, etc.)

### 6.3. Priority Overrides

You can override the default priority of sections:

```markdown
# Coding Standards (priority: high)
- Use PSR-12 for all PHP files
- Add type hints to all method parameters
```

Priority can be set to `high`, `medium`, or `low`. Higher priority sections will override lower priority sections with the same name.

### 6.4. File Includes

You can include other files in your addenda file:

```markdown
## Includes
- /path/to/another-addenda.md
- relative/path/to/addenda.md
```

This allows you to modularize your addenda and reuse common sections across multiple projects.

## 7. Web Interface

The AI Prompt Addenda system also includes a web interface for managing addenda files. To access it, navigate to:

```
http://your-project-url/aipa
```

The web interface provides:

- Visual editing with syntax highlighting
- Real-time validation
- Live preview of active addenda
- Template system for common use cases
- Documentation generation
