## 2. Evaluation Criteria

Recommended packages are evaluated based on:

- Compatibility with Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4
- Active maintenance and community support
- Integration with existing tools
- Value added to the development workflow
- Performance impact

2. Install the package with Composer
3. Publish any configuration files

5. Add documentation to the appropriate category

## 5. Comparison with Existing Tools

Before adding a new package, consider:

- Does it duplicate functionality of existing tools?

- Is it actively maintained and compatible with Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4?

## 6. Decision Making Process

When considering a new development package:

1. Evaluate it against the criteria above
2. Test it in a development environment
3. Document pros and cons
4. Make a recommendation with a confidence score
5. If adopted, add proper documentation
