# PostgreSQL Schema Fix Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains copies of the files that were modified to fix issues with PostgreSQL schema handling in the application.

## Background

When using PostgreSQL with Laravel, it's often desirable to use a custom schema instead of the default `public` schema. This provides better organization, security, and multi-tenancy capabilities. However, configuring Laravel to properly create and use a custom schema requires careful handling of:

1. Schema creation (before migrations run)
2. Setting the `search_path` to include the schema
3. Ensuring all connections use the correct schema

## Files in this Directory

### AppServiceProvider.php
Contains the service provider with commented-out `DB::whenReady` block that was causing `BadMethodCallException` errors during application boot. The problematic code was attempting to create schemas and set search paths during every connection establishment.

### SetupPostgresCommand.php
Command that creates a PostgreSQL schema and configures the search path. Can be run manually with `php artisan db:setup-postgres`.

### CheckEnvSource.php
Utility command for debugging environment variables used for database configuration. Run with `php artisan env:check --all` to check database-related environment variables.

### 0000_01_01_000000_create_postgres_schema.php
Migration file that runs before all other migrations to create the schema and set the search path. The `0000_` prefix ensures it runs first.

## Environment Configuration

For the schema configuration to work correctly, ensure:

1. Your `.env` file includes `DB_SCHEMA=your_schema_name`
2. Your `config/database.php` includes the configuration:
   ```php
   'pgsql' => [
       // ... other PostgreSQL config
       'search_path' => env('DB_SCHEMA', env('DB_SEARCH_PATH', 'public')),
   ],
   ```

## Runtime Operations

Two components ensure the schema is correctly set:

1. The migration (`0000_01_01_000000_create_postgres_schema.php`) creates the schema and sets the search path during migration
2. The `database.php` configuration reads `DB_SCHEMA` from the environment to set the search path for all connections

The problematic `DB::whenReady` block in `AppServiceProvider` was removed because it caused errors and was redundant with the above mechanisms.

## Issue and Fix Summary

1. **Issue**: The `BadMethodCallException: Method Illuminate\Database\PostgresConnection::whenReady does not exist.` error occurred during application boot.

2. **Root Cause**: The `DB::whenReady` method exists on the `DB` facade but not on the `PostgresConnection` class. The error happened because the code attempted to access this method on the connection object directly, not through the facade.

3. **Fix**: The problematic code block in `AppServiceProvider.php` was commented out because:
   - It was redundant with the migration-based schema creation
   - It was duplicating functionality already in `config/database.php`
   - The `whenReady` callback was triggering errors

4. **Proper Solution**: The solution implemented uses:
   - A dedicated migration that runs first to create the schema
   - Configuration in `database.php` to set the `search_path` based on environment variables
   - A CLI command (`db:setup-postgres`) for manual schema creation and management
