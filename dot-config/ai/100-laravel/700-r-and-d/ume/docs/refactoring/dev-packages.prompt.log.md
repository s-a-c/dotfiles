Augment
I'll help you review the documentation in the @docs/dev-packages directory and propose refactors, reorganizations, and consolidations. Let me first gather information about the current structure and content of these documents.
Augment Context Engine
Find all documentation files in the @docs/dev-packages directory. List their paths and a brief description of their content.
Let me continue gathering information about the dev packages in the project to understand what needs to be documented.
Augment Context Engine
Find the composer.json file and extract the "require-dev" section to see all development packages used in the project.
Let me check the current structure of the @docs/dev-packages directory to understand what files and folders exist.
Terminal
$ find docs/dev-packages -type f | sort
Now I'll check the content of the composer.json file to identify all dev packages that need to be documented.
Read file
composer.json
Based on my analysis of the current documentation structure and the dev packages in composer.json, I'll now propose a refactored documentation structure for the @docs/dev-packages directory.
Current Issues
Inconsistent Structure: The current documentation has inconsistent numbering and organization.
Incomplete Coverage: Not all dev packages in composer.json are documented.
Duplicate Content: There are duplicate files for some packages (e.g., multiple PHPStan configuration files).
Inconsistent Naming: File naming conventions are not consistent across the documentation.
Outdated Information: Some documentation may be outdated or not aligned with current package versions.
Proposed Refactored Structure
Here's my proposed refactored structure for the @docs/dev-packages directory:
Documents to be Modified
000-index.md - Update to reflect new structure and provide better navigation
All PHPStan documentation - Consolidate and organize in the 200-code-quality/010-phpstan directory
All testing documentation - Update and organize in the 100-testing directory
All debugging documentation - Update with latest package information
All code quality documentation - Reorganize and update with latest package versions
Documents to be Created
Documentation for missing packages:
rector/type-perfect
symfony/polyfill-php84
symfony/var-dumper
fakerphp/faker
ergebnis/composer-normalize
Documents for Deletion
Duplicate PHPStan files:
docs/dev-packages/010-code-quality/020-phpstan.md (consolidated into directory)
docs/dev-packages/010-code-quality/021-phpstan-workflow.md (consolidated)
docs/dev-packages/phpstan/README.md (consolidated)
docs/dev-packages/phpstan/baseline-management.md (consolidated)
Outdated or redundant files:
docs/dev-packages/100-testing_packages.md (replaced by 100-testing/000-index.md)
docs/dev-packages/prd.md (moved to 005-project-docs/005-prd.md)
docs/dev-packages/implementation-plan.md (moved to 005-project-docs/010-implementation-plan.md)
Incomplete Documents to be Retained and Completed
docs/dev-packages/030-recommended/000-index.md - Needs to be expanded with actual recommendations
docs/dev-packages/025-code-generation/000-index.md - Needs more detailed information about code generation tools
docs/dev-packages/020-dev-environment/000-index.md - Needs more comprehensive coverage of development environment tools
docs/dev-packages/configs/000-index.md - Needs to be updated with all configuration examples
docs/dev-packages/examples/000-index.md - Needs to be populated with practical examples
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Create the new directory structure
Phase 2: Move and update existing documentation to the new structure
Phase 3: Create documentation for missing packages
Phase 4: Delete duplicate and outdated files
Phase 5: Update the main index and navigation
Phase 6: Review and finalize all documentation
This refactored structure will provide a more consistent, comprehensive, and maintainable documentation for all development packages used in the project. It follows a logical organization by package type and ensures that all packages in composer.json are properly documented.
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this refactored structure, or would you like to provide feedback on the proposal first?
# *PROCEED* with the following, additional notes/instructions
* save the proposal as a PRD in its own subdirectory of @docs
* create and maintain a progress tracker
* when implemented create a completion report, corresponding to the PRD.
* resolve inconsistencies
* where a decision is required, show top 3 pros and cons of each selection
    - give a % score on fit with laravel best practice and custom (laravel 12 and php 8.4)
    - give your recommendation with a % score of your confidence

Let's add a note to the progress tracker about the next steps:
Edited file
010-progress-tracker.md
docs/refactoring/dev-packages
Now let's summarize what we've accomplished and outline the next steps:
Summary of Progress
I've completed Phase 1 of the dev packages documentation refactoring:
Created the PRD and planning documents:
Created a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Developed an Implementation Plan
Set up a Progress Tracker
Created a template for the Completion Report
Established the new directory structure:
Created a hierarchical structure with numeric prefixes for clear ordering
Organized packages by functional category (testing, code quality, debugging, etc.)
Created index files for each category with consistent formatting
Added a template for package documentation
Made key decisions:
Decided to use numeric prefixes for directories (e.g., 100-testing) for consistency and clear ordering
Created the new structure in a separate directory (docs/dev-packages-new) to avoid disrupting existing documentation
Documented the decision-making process with pros/cons and confidence scores
Proposed New Structure
The new documentation structure is organized as follows:
docs/dev-packages-new/
├── 000-index.md                           # Main index with overview of all dev packages
├── 005-project-docs/                      # Project-level documentation
├── 100-testing/                           # Testing packages documentation
├── 200-code-quality/                      # Code quality packages documentation
├── 300-debugging/                         # Debugging
Documents to be Modified in Phase 2
The next phase will involve moving and updating existing documentation to the new structure. Key documents to be modified include:
All PHPStan documentation (currently duplicated across multiple files)
Testing documentation (to be organized in the 100-testing directory)
Debugging documentation (to be updated with latest package information)
Code quality documentation (to be reorganized and updated)
Documents to be Created in Phase 3
Documentation for these packages will need to be created:
rector/type-perfect
symfony/polyfill-php84
symfony/var-dumper
fakerphp/faker
ergebnis/composer-normalize
Documents for Deletion in Phase 4
These duplicate or outdated files will be removed after their content is migrated:
docs/dev-packages/010-code-quality/020-phpstan.md
docs/dev-packages/010-code-quality/021-phpstan-workflow.md
docs/dev-packages/phpstan/README.md
docs/dev-packages/phpstan/baseline-management.md
docs/dev-packages/100-testing_packages.md
docs/dev-packages/prd.md
docs/dev-packages/implementation-plan.md
Next Steps
To continue with the implementation:
Begin Phase 2: Move and update existing documentation to the new structure
Start with consolidating the PHPStan documentation
Update all documentation to ensure it's relevant for Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4
Prepare for Phase 3: Research the missing packages to create comprehensive documentation
Plan for Phase 4: Verify that all valuable content has been preserved before deleting duplicate files

what is the problem?

Augment
I apologize for the confusion. It seems I'm encountering an issue with the str-replace-editor tool when trying to update the progress tracker. Let me try a different approach by viewing the current content first and then making a more targeted update:
Read file
010-progress-tracker.md
docs/refactoring/dev-packages
I see the issue now. It looks like the Configuration Examples section (lines 83-87) is already marked as completed in the progress tracker. Let me update the Templates section and then update the overall progress:

Progress Summary
We have successfully completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the dev packages documentation refactoring:
Phase 1: Create new directory structure (100%)
Created a hierarchical structure with numeric prefixes for clear ordering
Organized packages by functional category (testing, code quality, debugging, etc.)
Created index files for each category with consistent formatting
Added templates for package documentation
Phase 2: Move and update existing documentation (100%)
Created comprehensive documentation for all categories:
Project Documentation
Code Quality (PHPStan, Pint, Rector, etc.)
Debugging (Debugbar, Ray, Pail, etc.)
Dev Environment (Sail, Peck, Solo, etc.)
Code Generation (Eloquent Model Generator, IDE Helper)
Utilities (Collision, Faker, Var Dumper)
Recommended Packages
Configuration Examples
Templates
Next Steps
The next phases of the implementation are:
Phase 3: Create documentation for missing packages (0%)
Create documentation for rector/type-perfect
Create documentation for symfony/polyfill-php84
Create documentation for other missing packages
Phase 4: Delete duplicate and outdated files (0%)
Delete duplicate PHPStan files
Delete outdated or redundant files
Ensure all valuable content has been preserved
Phase 5: Update main index and navigation (0%)
Update the main index file with comprehensive navigation
Ensure all category index files link to their child documents
Verify all navigation paths are correct
Phase 6: Review and finalize all documentation (0%)
Review all documentation for consistency
Verify all packages in composer.json are documented
Check for broken links and formatting issues
Create the completion report
Decisions Made
During the implementation, we made several key decisions:
Directory Structure: We used numeric prefixes for directories (e.g., 100-testing) to provide clear ordering and maintain consistency with the existing structure.
Documentation Format: We standardized the documentation format with consistent headings, sections, and formatting across all files.
Content Organization: We organized content by package category, with each category having its own directory and index file.
Templates: We created templates for package documentation, category indexes, and configuration examples to ensure consistency in future documentation.
Would you like me to proceed with Phase 3 (creating documentation for missing packages) next?

Augment
I'll proceed with Phase 3: Creating documentation for missing packages. Let's start by updating the progress tracker to reflect that we're beginning Phase 3:
Edited file
010-progress-tracker.md
docs/refactoring/dev-packages
Now, let's first identify the missing packages that need documentation. According to our progress tracker, we need to create documentation for:
rector/type-perfect
symfony/polyfill-php84
Let's start by creating documentation for rector/type-perfect:
Created file
040-type-perfect.md
docs/dev-packages-new/200-code-quality/030-rector
Now let's update the Rector index file to include the Type Perfect documentation:
Edited file
000-index.md

Verified all navigation paths are correct
Phase 6: Review and finalize all documentation (100%)
Reviewed all documentation for consistency
Verified all packages in composer.json are documented
Checked for broken links and formatting issues
Created a comprehensive completion report
New Documentation Structure
The new documentation structure is organized as follows:
docs/dev-packages-new/
├── 000-index.md                           # Main index with overview of all dev packages
├── 005-project-docs/                      # Project-level documentation
├── 100-testing/                           # Testing packages documentation
├── 200-code-quality/                      # Code quality packages documentation
├── 300-debugging/                         # Debugging
Next Steps
Now that the documentation refactoring is complete, here are the recommended next steps:
Move to Final Location: Move the contents of docs/dev-packages-new/ to docs/dev-packages/ once approved
Update Links: Update any links in other documentation that point to the old structure
Announce Changes: Inform the team about the new documentation structure
Gather Feedback: Collect feedback from team members on the new documentation
Ongoing Maintenance: Establish a process for keeping the documentation up-to-date
Conclusion
The dev packages documentation refactoring has been successfully completed. The new documentation structure provides a clear, comprehensive, and consistent reference for all development packages used in the project. The documentation is now relevant for Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4, and includes all packages listed in composer.json.
The new structure makes it easier to find information about specific packages, understand their configuration and usage, and troubleshoot common issues. The addition of templates and standardized formatting will ensure that future documentation remains consistent and high-quality.

Augment
I'll proceed with the final steps to complete this project. Let's start by moving the contents from the temporary docs/dev-packages-new/ directory to the final docs/dev-packages/ location:
First, let's check if the destination directory exists:
Terminal
$ ls -la docs/dev-packages
I see that the destination directory exists and has content. Since we've already deleted the duplicate files in Phase 4, we need to move our new documentation to replace the old structure. Let's create a plan for this:
First, let's back up the existing directory structure
Then, move our new documentation to the final location
Finally, verify the move was successful
Let's start with backing up the existing directory:
Terminal
$ mkdir -p docs/dev-packages-backup && cp -r docs/dev-packages/* docs/dev-packages-backup/
Now that we've backed up the existing directory, let's move our new documentation to the final location. We'll need to remove the existing content first:
Terminal
$ rm -rf docs/dev-packages/* && cp -r docs/dev-packages-new/* docs/dev-packages/
Let's verify that the move was successful by checking the contents of the final directory:
Terminal
$ ls -la docs/dev-packages
Great! The move was successful. Now let's check the main index file to make sure it's properly formatted:
Read lines 1-30
000-index.md
docs/dev-packages
The main index file looks good. Let's also check the completion report to make sure it's properly formatted:
Read lines 1-30
020-completion-report.md
docs/dev-packages/005-project-docs
Let's update the directory path in the completion report since we've now moved the files to their final location:
Edited file
020-completion-report.md
docs/dev-packages/005-project-docs
Now let's update the progress tracker to reflect that we've completed the final step of moving the documentation to its final location:
Edited file
010-progress-tracker.md
docs/refactoring/dev-packages
Let's also update the completion report to mention that we've moved the documentation to its final location:
Edited file
020-completion-report.md
docs/dev-packages/005-project-docs
Final Summary
I've successfully completed all phases of the dev packages documentation refactoring project:
Created a new directory structure with clear organization and numeric prefixes
Moved and updated existing documentation to be relevant for Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4
Created documentation for missing packages including rector/type-perfect and symfony/polyfill-php84
Deleted duplicate and outdated files to eliminate redundancy
Updated main index and navigation for comprehensive cross-linking
Reviewed and finalized all documentation for consistency and completeness
Moved documentation to final location in the docs/dev-packages/ directory
Key Accomplishments:
Created comprehensive documentation for all development packages in the project
Standardized documentation format with consistent sections across all files
Added templates for future documentation to ensure consistency
Organized packages by functional category for easier navigation
Updated all documentation to be relevant for Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4
Created a detailed completion report documenting the process and outcomes
Final Directory Structure:
docs/dev-packages/
├── 000-index.md                           # Main index with overview of all dev packages
├── 005-project-docs/                      # Project-level documentation
├── 100-testing/                           # Testing packages documentation

├── 300-debugging/                         # Debugging
Recommendations for Ongoing Maintenance:
Use Templates: Use the provided templates for any new package documentation
Maintain Directory Structure: Continue using the numeric prefix system for clear ordering
Regular Updates: Update documentation when upgrading packages or Laravel versions
Version Control: Keep documentation under version control alongside code
Documentation Reviews: Include documentation review in code review process
The project is now complete, with all documentation moved to its final location and ready for use by the development team.
