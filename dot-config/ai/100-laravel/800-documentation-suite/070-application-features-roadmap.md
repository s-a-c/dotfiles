#### Feature 2: Organization Hierarchy Management Interface

**User Story**:

> "As an organization administrator, I want to create and manage hierarchical organization structures with flexible permission inheritance."

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Organization Hierarchy Management

  Scenario: Creating nested organization structure
    Given I am an organization administrator
    When I create a new sub-organization under my organization
    Then the sub-organization should inherit permissions from the parent
    And I should be able to override specific permissions
    And the hierarchy should be visually represented in the interface
    And changes should be tracked for audit purposes

  Scenario: Managing cross-organizational permissions
    Given I have multiple organizations in my hierarchy
    When I set up collaboration between organizations
    Then users should be able to collaborate across organizational boundaries
    And permission inheritance should work correctly
    And audit trails should track cross-organizational access
```

**Technical Implementation**:

```php
// Self-referencing organization model with STI
class Organization extends Model
{
    use HasUnifiedIdentifiers, SoftDeletes;

    protected $fillable = ['name', 'type', 'parent_id', 'settings'];

    // Self-referencing relationship
    public function parent(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Organization::class, 'parent_id');
    }

    public function children(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Organization::class, 'parent_id');
    }

    // Recursive hierarchy methods
    public function getAllAncestors(): Collection
    {
        $ancestors = collect();
        $current = $this->parent;

        while ($current) {
            $ancestors->push($current);
            $current = $current->parent;
        }

    {
        return $this->children->reduce(function ($descendants, $child) {
            return $descendants->concat($child->getAllDescendants())->push($child);
        }, collect());
    }

    // Permission inheritance
    public function getEffectivePermissions(): array
    {
        $permissions = $this->permissions ?? [];

        // Inherit from ancestors
        foreach ($this->getAllAncestors() as $ancestor) {
            $permissions = array_merge($ancestor->permissions ?? [], $permissions);
        }

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Collaborative Content Editing

  Scenario: Real-time collaborative editing
    Given multiple users are editing the same document
    When we make changes simultaneously
    Then changes should be merged intelligently
    And we should see each other's cursors and selections
    And conflicts should be highlighted and resolved gracefully
    And the complete edit history should be preserved

  Scenario: Conflict resolution interface
    Given a conflict occurs during collaborative editing
    When the conflict is detected
    Then users should see a clear conflict resolution interface
    And they should be able to choose between conflicting changes
    And the resolution should be applied across all editing sessions

#### Feature 6: Advanced Content Versioning and History

**User Story**:

> "As a content manager, I want complete visibility into content evolution with the ability to compare versions, restore previous states, and understand the context of changes."

**Acceptance Criteria**:

```gherkin
Feature: Content Version Management

  Scenario: Visual version comparison
    Given I have a document with multiple versions
    When I select two versions to compare
    Then I should see a visual diff highlighting all changes
    And I should see who made each change and when
    And I should be able to restore specific sections from previous versions
    And I should understand the business context of changes

  Scenario: Branching and merging content
    Given I want to create experimental versions of content
    When I create a content branch
    Then I should be able to make changes without affecting the main version
    And I should be able to merge successful changes back
    And conflicts should be resolved through the same interface as collaborative editing
```

**Technical Implementation**:

```php
// Advanced content versioning
class ContentVersionManager
{
    public function createBranch(string $contentId, string $branchName, User $user): ContentBranch
    {
        $currentVersion = $this->getCurrentVersion($contentId);

        $branch = ContentBranch::create([
            'content_id' => $contentId,
            'name' => $branchName,
            'created_by' => $user->id,
            'branched_from_version' => $currentVersion->version,
            'created_at' => now(),
        ]);

        // Event for branch creation
        ContentBranchCreatedEvent::dispatch($contentId, $branchName, $user);

        return $branch;
    }

    public function mergeBranch(string $contentId, string $branchName, User $user): MergeResult
    {
        $branch = $this->getBranch($contentId, $branchName);
        $mainContent = $this->getContent($contentId);

        // Get changes since branch point
        $branchChanges = $this->getBranchChanges($branch);
        $mainChanges = $this->getMainChanges($contentId, $branch->branched_from_version);

        // Detect merge conflicts
        $conflicts = $this->detectMergeConflicts($branchChanges, $mainChanges);

        if ($conflicts->isNotEmpty()) {
            return new MergeResult(
                success: false,
                conflicts: $conflicts,
                requiresManualResolution: true
            );
        }

        // Apply branch changes to main content
        foreach ($branchChanges as $change) {
            $this->applyChange($contentId, $change, $user);
        }

        // Record merge event
        ContentBranchMergedEvent::dispatch($contentId, $branchName, $user);

        return new MergeResult(success: true);
    }

    public function generateVersionDiff(string $contentId, int $fromVersion, int $toVersion): VersionDiff
    {
        $fromContent = $this->getContentAtVersion($contentId, $fromVersion);
        $toContent = $this->getContentAtVersion($contentId, $toVersion);

        return new VersionDiff([
            'content_id' => $contentId,
            'from_version' => $fromVersion,
            'to_version' => $toVersion,
            'changes' => $this->calculateDiff($fromContent, $toContent),
            'metadata' => $this->getDiffMetadata($contentId, $fromVersion, $toVersion),
        ]);
    }
}
```
