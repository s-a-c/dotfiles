## 7.3. Critical Risk Analysis (ðŸ”´ Priority 1)

### 7.3.1. Database Migration and Identifier Strategy Risk

**Risk Description**: Migration from auto-increment IDs to UUIDs across all tables poses significant risk of data corruption, performance degradation, and application downtime.

**Probability**: ðŸ”´ **75%** - Complex cross-table relationships and large data volumes

**Impact Assessment**:

-   **Technical**: Data corruption, foreign key constraint failures, query performance degradation
-   **Business**: Potential 24-48 hour system downtime, data integrity issues, customer trust loss
-   **Financial**: Â£50-100k revenue impact, potential legal/compliance issues

**Root Causes**:

-   Complex foreign key relationships across multiple streams
-   Large existing data volumes requiring migration
-   Insufficient testing infrastructure for data migration scenarios
-   Potential performance impact on UUID-based queries

**Mitigation Strategies**:

#### Primary Mitigation: Blue-Green Deployment with Data Validation

```php
// Comprehensive migration strategy
class DatabaseMigrationOrchestrator
{
    public function executeMigration(): MigrationResult
    {
        try {
            // Phase 1: Create new schema alongside existing
            $this->createParallelSchema();

            // Phase 2: Dual-write to both schemas
            $this->enableDualWrite();

            // Phase 3: Backfill historical data with validation
            $this->backfillWithValidation();

            // Phase 4: Switch reads to new schema
            $this->switchReads();

            // Phase 5: Validate data consistency
            $consistencyCheck = $this->validateDataConsistency();

            if (!$consistencyCheck->isValid()) {
                throw new MigrationValidationException($consistencyCheck->getErrors());
            }

            // Phase 6: Remove old schema
            $this->cleanupOldSchema();

            return new MigrationResult(success: true);

        } catch (Exception $e) {
            // Automatic rollback procedure
            $this->executeRollback();
            throw new MigrationFailedException($e->getMessage(), previous: $e);
        }
    }

    private function validateDataConsistency(): ConsistencyReport
    {
        $report = new ConsistencyReport();

        // Validate record counts
        $report->addCheck('record_counts', $this->validateRecordCounts());

        // Validate relationship integrity
        $report->addCheck('relationships', $this->validateRelationships());

        // Validate data integrity
        $report->addCheck('data_integrity', $this->validateDataIntegrity());

        return $report;
    }
}
```

#### Secondary Mitigation: Performance Optimization

```php
// UUID performance optimization
class OptimizedUUIDModel extends Model
{
    protected $keyType = 'string';
    public $incrementing = false;

    // Binary UUID storage for better performance
    protected $casts = [
        'id' => 'uuid_binary',
    ];

    // Optimized queries with proper indexing
    public function scopeOptimizedFind($query, string $id)
    {
        return $query->where('id', hex2bin(str_replace('-', '', $id)));
    }

    // Connection pooling and query optimization
    public function getConnectionName()
    {
        return config('database.optimized_connection');
    }
}
```

**Contingency Plans**:

-   **Rollback Strategy**: Automated rollback to previous schema within 15 minutes

    // Required metadata for all events
    protected array $requiredMetadata = [
        'stream_id',
        'aggregate_id',
        'user_id',
        'timestamp',
        'correlation_id',
        'causation_id',
    ];

    // Event schema validation
    protected function validateEventData(): void
    {
        $validator = $this->getSchemaValidator();

        if (!$validator->validate($this->getEventData())) {
            throw new InvalidEventSchemaException(
                $validator->getErrors(),
                $this->getEventType()
            );
        }
    }

    // Automatic event versioning
    public function getEventVersion(): string
    {
        return $this->eventVersion ?? '1.0.0';
    }

    // Cross-stream correlation
    public function getCorrelationId(): string
    {
        return $this->correlation_id ?? request()->header('X-Correlation-ID') ?? Str::uuid();
    }
}

// Migration strategy for existing events
class EventMigrationService
{
    public function migrateEventStream(string $streamId): MigrationResult
    {
        $events = $this->getExistingEvents($streamId);
        $migratedEvents = [];

        foreach ($events as $event) {
            try {
                $migratedEvent = $this->migrateEvent($event);
                $this->validateMigratedEvent($migratedEvent);
                $migratedEvents[] = $migratedEvent;
            } catch (Exception $e) {
                $this->logMigrationError($event, $e);
                throw new EventMigrationException("Failed to migrate event: {$event->id}");
            }
        }

        // Store migrated events in parallel stream
        $this->storeMigratedEvents($streamId, $migratedEvents);

        return new MigrationResult(
            processed: count($events),
            migrated: count($migratedEvents),
            errors: $this->getMigrationErrors()
        );
    }
}
```

        private CircuitBreakerService $circuitBreaker,
        private EventQueue $eventQueue,
        private RetryService $retryService
    ) {}

    public function publishToStream(string $targetStream, DomainEvent $event): PublishResult
    {
        $circuitBreakerKey = "stream.{$targetStream}";

        return $this->circuitBreaker->execute($circuitBreakerKey, function() use ($targetStream, $event) {
            try {
                // Attempt direct delivery
                $result = $this->sendEventDirectly($targetStream, $event);

                if ($result->isSuccessful()) {
                    $this->circuitBreaker->recordSuccess($circuitBreakerKey);
                    return $result;
                }

                throw new StreamDeliveryException("Direct delivery failed");

            } catch (Exception $e) {
                // Fallback to async queue
                $this->eventQueue->enqueue($targetStream, $event);
                $this->circuitBreaker->recordFailure($circuitBreakerKey);

                return new PublishResult(
                    delivered: false,
                    queued: true,
                    error: $e->getMessage()
                );
            }
        });
    }

    public function subscribeToStream(string $sourceStream, callable $handler): Subscription
    {
        return new StreamSubscription([
            'source_stream' => $sourceStream,
