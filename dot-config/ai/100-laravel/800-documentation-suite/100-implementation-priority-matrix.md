# 8.5. Implementation Priority Matrix

## 8.5.1. Overview

This document provides a prioritized decision matrix for implementing R&D features across all streams, designed specifically for junior developers to understand what to work on first and why.

**Confidence Score: 88%** - Very high confidence based on risk analysis, business value assessment, and technical complexity evaluation.

## 8.5.2. Priority Scoring Methodology

### 8.5.2.1. Scoring Criteria

Each implementation item is scored on a 1-10 scale across four dimensions:

| Criterion                 | Weight | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Value**        | 35%    | Revenue impact, user satisfaction, competitive advantage |
| **Technical Risk**        | 25%    | Implementation complexity, integration challenges        |
| **Dependencies**          | 20%    | Blocking relationships, prerequisite requirements        |
| **Resource Requirements** | 20%    | Development time, skill requirements, infrastructure     |

### 8.5.2.2. Priority Calculation

```
Priority Score = (Business Value × 0.35) + (10 - Technical Risk) × 0.25) +
                ((10 - Dependencies) × 0.20) + ((10 - Resource Requirements) × 0.20)
```

**Priority Levels:**

-   **P0 (9.0-10.0)**: Critical - Start immediately
-   **P1 (7.5-8.9)**: High - Start within 2 weeks
-   **P2 (6.0-7.4)**: Medium - Start within 1 month
-   **P3 (4.0-5.9)**: Low - Start within 3 months
-   **P4 (0.0-3.9)**: Deferred - Consider for future releases

## 8.5.3. Critical Priority Items (P0)

### 8.5.3.1. Universal Identifier Strategy

**Priority Score: 9.2**

-   Business Value: 8/10 (Enables all cross-stream features)
-   Technical Risk: 7/10 (Moderate complexity, well-defined solution)
-   Dependencies: 9/10 (Blocks most integration work)
-   Resource Requirements: 6/10 (3-4 weeks, 2 developers)

**Implementation Order:**

1. Create `UniversalIdentifier` trait
2. Update E_L_A stream models
3. Update StandAloneComplex models
4. Update ume models
5. Update lsk-livewire components

**Code Example:**

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

trait UniversalIdentifier
{
    public function getUniversalId(): string
    {
        return match(true) {
            $this->hasUuid() => $this->uuid,
            $this->hasCompositeKey() => "{$this->tenant_id}:{$this->entity_id}",
            default => "int:{$this->id}"
        };
    }

    public function fromUniversalId(string $universalId): ?Model
    {
        if (str_starts_with($universalId, 'int:')) {
            return $this->find((int) substr($universalId, 4));
        }

        if (str_contains($universalId, ':')) {
            [$tenantId, $entityId] = explode(':', $universalId, 2);
            return $this->where('tenant_id', $tenantId)
                       ->where('entity_id', $entityId)
                       ->first();

abstract class BaseSTIModel extends Model
{
    protected $guarded = [];

    public static function boot(): void
    {
        parent::boot();

        static::creating(function ($model) {
            if (!$model->type) {
                $model->type = static::getModelType();
            }
        });
    }

    abstract public static function getModelType(): string;

    public function newQuery()
    {
        return parent::newQuery()->where('type', static::getModelType());
    }
}

class AdminUser extends BaseSTIModel
{
    public static function getModelType(): string
    {
        return 'admin';
    }
}
```

### 8.5.4.2. CQRS Command/Query Separation

**Priority Score: 8.1**

**Implementation Pattern:**

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

abstract class Command
{
    public readonly string $id;
    public readonly Carbon $issuedAt;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->id = Str::uuid();
        $this->issuedAt = now();
    }
}

abstract class Query
{
    public readonly string $id;
    public readonly Carbon $issuedAt;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->id = Str::uuid();
        $this->issuedAt = now();
    }
}

interface CommandHandler
{
    public function handle(Command $command): void;
}

interface QueryHandler
{
    public function handle(Query $query): mixed;
}
```

### 8.5.4.3. Cross-Stream Authorization Framework

**Priority Score: 7.8**

-   Business Value: 9/10 (Critical for security and compliance)
-   Technical Risk: 7/10 (Complex integration across streams)
-   Dependencies: 6/10 (Requires universal identifiers)
-   Resource Requirements: 6/10 (4-5 weeks, 2-3 developers)

### 8.5.4.4. Enterprise Data Processing Infrastructure

**Priority Score: 8.0**

-   Business Value: 9/10 (Enables enterprise integration and reporting capabilities)
-   Technical Risk: 5/10 (Well-established packages, clear implementation patterns)
-   Dependencies: 4/10 (Benefits from event sourcing but can operate independently)
-   Resource Requirements: 5/10 (3-4 weeks, 2 developers)

**Implementation Strategy:**

The data processing infrastructure implements three core packages for enterprise-grade data transformation and export capabilities:

1. **API Transformation Layer** (`league/fractal` + `spatie/laravel-fractal`)
2. **Excel Processing Engine** (`maatwebsite/laravel-excel`)
3. **Integrated Data Pipeline** (Combined workflows)

**Key Implementation Components:**

```php
// 1. Install core packages
composer require league/fractal spatie/laravel-fractal maatwebsite/excel

// 2. Create base transformer for consistent API responses
abstract class BaseTransformer extends TransformerAbstract
{
    protected array $defaultIncludes = [];
    protected array $availableIncludes = [];
    
    abstract public function transform($resource): array;
    
    protected function applySecurityFilters(array $data): array
    {
        // Field-level security implementation
        return array_filter($data, fn($field) => 
            auth()->user()->can("view-{$field}")
        );
    }
}

// 3. Excel export with transformer integration
class SecureExport implements FromCollection, WithMapping, ShouldQueue
{
    use Exportable, Queueable;
    
    public function map($row): array
    {
        $transformed = fractal($row, $this->transformer)->toArray();
        return array_values($transformed['data']);
    }
}
```

**Business Value Delivered:**

-   **Enterprise Integration:** Standardized data exchange with external systems
-   **Compliance Reporting:** Audit-ready export capabilities with security controls
-   **API Consistency:** Unified transformation layer across all endpoints
-   **Performance Scaling:** Queue-based processing for large datasets

**Success Metrics:**

-   [ ] API response consistency >98% across all endpoints
-   [ ] Excel exports handle 100k+ rows within performance thresholds
-   [ ] Security filtering prevents unauthorized data access
-   [ ] Integration with event sourcing provides complete audit trail

**Risk Mitigation:**

-   Use established packages with strong Laravel ecosystem support
-   Implement progressive enhancement (basic exports first, advanced features later)
-   Queue processing prevents memory issues with large datasets
-   Security-first approach with field-level access controls

**Dependencies:**

-   Optional: Event sourcing integration for audit trails
-   Optional: CQRS implementation for optimized read models
-   Required: Basic Laravel authentication for security filtering

**Confidence Score: 85%** - High confidence due to mature package ecosystem and clear implementation patterns.

## 8.5.13. Conclusion

This priority matrix provides a clear roadmap for junior developers, emphasizing the critical foundation work (Universal Identifiers and Event Store Consolidation) that enables all subsequent features. The phased approach balances business value delivery with technical risk management.

**Key Takeaways for Junior Developers:**

1. Always start with P0 items - they're critical for everything else
2. Don't skip foundation work to build features - it will cause problems later
3. Ask for help early on P0 and P1 items - they're complex for good reasons
4. P2 and P3 items are great learning opportunities with lower risk
5. Follow the dependency chart - some things must be done in order

**Recommended Next Action:** Begin with Universal Identifier Strategy implementation, as it has the highest priority score (9.2) and enables the most subsequent work.
