1. **Start with Task 1.1** - Environment Validation
2. **Follow sequential order** - Each task builds on the previous
3. **Update progress** - Mark completion percentages as you go
4. **Document issues** - Note any problems encountered
5. **Test thoroughly** - Validate each phase before proceeding

## 📞 Communication Protocol

When discussing tasks, use the task number (e.g., "Task 2.3" for Spatie Content Management) for clear communication.

## 🌿 Version Control Notes

This project uses **Jujutsu (jj)** in a colocated Git repository. All commit references in tasks refer to `jj` commands rather than traditional git workflow. Each phase completion should be committed as a logical change with proper description.

## 🔄 Progress Updates

Update this document as tasks are completed, noting:
- Completion percentage
- Any issues encountered  
- Time taken vs. estimated
- Any deviations from planned approach
