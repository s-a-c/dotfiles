# Node.js Packages Configuration

## 4.1 Overview

This document provides detailed information about the Node.js packages used in the AureusERP project. It includes each package's primary purpose, configuration requirements, and the principles, patterns, and practices relevant to their usage.

AureusERP uses Node.js packages primarily for:
- Frontend build tools and bundling
- JavaScript frameworks and utilities
- Development tooling and testing
- Code quality and formatting

The project uses pnpm as the package manager and requires Node.js >= 22.0.0 as specified in the `engines` field of package.json.

**Primary Purpose:**
These plugins extend Alpine.js with additional functionality for specific use cases, such as form masking, intersection observation, focus management, and more.

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Registration in JavaScript entry point
- Plugin-specific configuration options
- Selective inclusion based on needs

**Principles and Patterns:**
- Modular functionality extension
- Declarative usage in HTML
- Minimal bundle size through selective inclusion

- Request interceptors for authentication

**Principles and Patterns:**
- Promise-based API for async requests
- Request and response interception
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Cross-browser compatibility

## 4.4 Development Tools

### 4.4.1 TypeScript

**Package:** `typescript`

**Primary Purpose:**
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It's used for type checking and improved developer experience.

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Configuration file: `tsconfig.json`
- Type definitions for libraries
- Compiler options for strictness level
- Path aliases for import resolution

**Principles and Patterns:**
- Static type checking for JavaScript
- Interface-based design
- Type inference for reduced verbosity
- Gradual adoption with allowJs option

### 4.4.2 ESLint

**Package:** `eslint`

**Primary Purpose:**
ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It's used to enforce code quality and consistency.

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Configuration via `.eslintrc.js` or package.json

- Use workspace features for monorepo management
- Document version requirements in package.json

### 4.5.2 Build Configuration

- Optimize build settings for development and production
- Configure code splitting for improved performance
- Implement tree shaking to reduce bundle size
- Use environment variables for environment-specific settings

### 4.5.3 Code Quality Tools

- Automate code quality checks in CI/CD pipelines
- Use pre-commit hooks for local quality enforcement
- Balance strictness with developer productivity

### 4.5.4 Testing Strategy

- Write tests for critical frontend functionality
- Configure coverage thresholds for important code
- Implement both unit and integration tests
- Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies
