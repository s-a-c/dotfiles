  - Created a PHPStan configuration file for test-specific rules
  - Created a script to run the linting rules on test files
  - Documented the linting rules and how to use them

## Technical Details

The new tests verify:
- Proper inheritance from base classes
- Correct attribute values and relationships
- Proper implementation of traits and interfaces
- Boot methods functionality (for BankAccount)
- Category hierarchy and full_name generation (for Category)
- Sequence prefix generation (for CreditNote)

The BankAccount test specifically verifies that the account_holder_name is properly set and updated based on the partner's name, as implemented in the model's boot methods.

The Category test includes verification of the category hierarchy functionality, ensuring that parent-child relationships are correctly established and that the full_name is properly generated based on the hierarchy.

The CreditNote test verifies the sequence prefix generation functionality, ensuring that the correct prefix is generated based on the move_type (OUT_REFUND generates 'RINV/' prefix).

The Incoterm test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Incoterm class, ensuring that all attributes and relationships are properly inherited and that the model uses the SoftDeletes trait.

The Partner test verifies the complex inheritance chain (Invoice Partner extends Account Partner extends Base Partner), tests the additional fillable fields from the Account Partner class, and verifies the functionality of methods like getAvatarUrlAttribute and canAccessPanel. It also tests the relationships with various models including Country, State, User, Title, Company, Industry, BankAccount, and Tag.

The Payment test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Payment class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and log attributes. It also tests the relationships with various models including Move, Journal, Company, BankAccount, PaymentMethodLine, PaymentMethod, Currency, Partner, Account, User, PaymentTransaction, and PaymentToken.

The Refund test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Move class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits. It also tests the sequence prefix generation functionality, ensuring that the correct prefix is generated based on the move_type (IN_REFUND generates 'RBILL/' prefix).

The Tax test verifies the inheritance from the base Account Tax class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and interfaces. It also tests the boot method that automatically creates distribution records for invoice and refund when a tax is created, and verifies the parent-child relationships between taxes.

The TaxGroup test verifies the inheritance from the base Account TaxGroup class, tests the attributes and relationships, and verifies the model's traits and interfaces. It also tests the sortable configuration to ensure that tax groups can be properly ordered.

The Payments plugin tests verify the basic properties of the Payment, PaymentToken, and PaymentTransaction models. Since these models are very simple (they only extend the base Eloquent Model class and use the HasFactory trait), the tests focus on verifying that the models exist, extend the correct base class, use the expected traits, and have the correct table names.

The Products plugin tests verify a wide range of functionality including:
- Attribute and AttributeOption models with their sortable configuration and relationships
- Category model with its hierarchy functionality and parent-child relationships
- Packaging model with its relationships to products and companies
- PriceList and PriceRule models with their currency and company relationships
- PriceRuleItem model with its complex relationships and enum type casts
- Product model with its variants, attributes, and supplier information
- ProductAttribute and ProductAttributeValue models with their relationships to products and attributes
- ProductCombination model with its role in configurable products
- ProductSupplier model with its date range functionality and supplier selection logic
- Tag model with its relationships to products

The ProductSupplier tests specifically verify date range functionality for supplier validity periods, allowing the system to determine which suppliers are currently active. They also demonstrate how to find the cheapest supplier or suppliers that can fulfill specific quantity requirements.

The ProductCombination tests verify the complex relationships between configurable products, their variants, and the attribute combinations that define them, ensuring that product variants are correctly associated with their attribute values.

The Feature tests for the Invoices plugin resources verify that the HTTP endpoints for managing invoices, credit notes, partners, payments, and products are working correctly. These tests ensure that users can view, create, edit, and manage these resources through the web interface. The tests specifically verify:
- Resource listing pages load successfully
- Resource creation pages load successfully
- Resources can be created with valid data
- Resources can be viewed and edited
- Special pages like product attributes and variants load correctly

## Next Steps

We have completed the following tasks:
1. Created unit tests for all models in the Invoices, Payments, and Products plugins
2. Implemented Feature tests for resources in the Invoices plugin
3. Explored the Payments plugin and found it doesn't have resources with direct HTTP endpoints
4. Explored the Products plugin and found its resources are accessed through other plugins
5. Verified that the Payments and Products plugins don't have service classes that would need integration tests
6. Ensured that critical business logic in the Products plugin (primarily in models) is already tested
7. Verified all tests pass and provide meaningful feedback on failures

With these tasks completed, we have successfully expanded test coverage for the AureusERP plugins and made significant progress on standardizing test style and approach. We have:
1. Created a comprehensive style guide document for test creation
2. Defined standards for PHP attributes usage in tests
3. Developed templates for Unit, Feature, and Integration tests
4. Created generators for new tests to ensure consistency
5. Audited existing tests and updated them to follow the standard style
6. Implemented linting rules to enforce test style standards

We have also completed the following additional tasks:
1. Enhanced the TestCase class with utilities and helpers
2. Implemented test coverage reporting
3. Added specific test categories
4. Improved test documentation
5. Optimized test performance

## Guidelines Restructuring

To make it easier for developers to find and follow the comprehensive testing guidelines that were developed as part of this initiative, we have restructured the project guidelines to include a dedicated section for testing standards:

- Created a new numbered guideline file `060-testing-standards.md` that serves as an index to all testing-related guidelines
- Updated the main index (`000-index.md`) to include a reference to the new testing standards section
- Added a note in the Development Standards document (`030-development-standards.md`) to direct users to the comprehensive testing standards
- Organized all existing testing-related guidelines under the new testing standards section

The new Testing Standards document provides a comprehensive overview of testing standards for the AureusERP project, including:

- Test organization and directory structure
- Naming conventions for test classes and methods
- Test data management using factories and isolation techniques
- Assertion best practices and common assertions
- Documentation standards for test classes and methods
- Test categories and grouping using PHP attributes
- Performance considerations and optimization techniques
- Required and optional testing tools and extensions
- Continuous integration and reporting requirements

The document also includes links to more detailed testing-related guidelines, such as the Comprehensive Testing Guide, Plugin Testing Guidelines, Test Categories, Test Coverage, Test Data Requirements, Test Examples, Test Helpers and Utilities, and Test Linting Rules.

This restructuring makes it easier for developers to find and follow the testing standards, while still maintaining the structured format of the guidelines.
