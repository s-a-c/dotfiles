# Product Requirements Document: Testing Framework Improvement

## Introduction/Overview

The AureusERP project currently has a well-defined testing framework with good examples and documentation. However, the actual test coverage is limited to just one plugin (Accounts), leaving most of the codebase untested. This feature aims to implement the recommendations from the testing framework analysis to significantly improve the test suite and overall code quality of the AureusERP project.

## Goals

1. Increase plugin test coverage from 5% (1/22 plugins) to at least 50% (11/22 plugins) in the first phase
2. Standardize test style and approach across all test files
3. Enhance the TestCase class with common utilities and helpers
4. Implement test coverage reporting with defined targets
5. Add more specific test categories for better organization
6. Improve test documentation to facilitate easier test creation and maintenance
7. Optimize test performance for faster feedback cycles

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to have comprehensive test coverage for all plugins so that I can make changes with confidence.
2. As a developer, I want standardized test styles and templates so that I can quickly create new tests that follow best practices.
3. As a developer, I want common test utilities and helpers so that I can avoid duplicating test setup code.
4. As a developer, I want test coverage reports so that I can identify areas of the codebase that need more testing.
5. As a QA engineer, I want more specific test categories so that I can run targeted test suites for specific functionality.
6. As a new team member, I want improved test documentation so that I can understand how to write tests for the project.
7. As a developer, I want optimized test performance so that I can get faster feedback during development.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Plugin Test Coverage**
   1.1. Create Unit, Feature, and Integration tests for at least 10 additional plugins beyond the Accounts plugin
   1.2. Ensure each plugin has tests for models, HTTP endpoints, and service classes
   1.3. Prioritize plugins based on business criticality and complexity

2. **Test Style Standardization**
   2.1. Create a style guide document for test creation
   2.2. Enforce consistent use of PHP attributes for all tests
   2.3. Develop templates or generators for new tests
   2.4. Update existing tests to follow the standard style

3. **TestCase Enhancement**
   3.1. Add common test utilities and helpers to the base TestCase class
   3.2. Create traits for specific test scenarios (e.g., API testing, authentication)
   3.3. Implement test data factories for all models
   3.4. Add methods for common assertions and test setup

4. **Test Coverage Reporting**
   4.1. Configure tools to generate test coverage reports
   4.2. Set coverage targets for each plugin (minimum 70% coverage)
   4.3. Integrate coverage reporting into CI/CD pipeline
   4.4. Create a dashboard for visualizing test coverage metrics

5. **Test Categories Implementation**
   5.1. Add more granular test groups beyond unit/feature/integration
   5.2. Implement technical categories (database, API, UI, performance)
   5.3. Create domain-specific categories for business logic areas
   5.4. Add categories for security, validation, and error handling tests

6. **Test Documentation Improvement**
   6.1. Add inline documentation to existing tests
   6.2. Create plugin-specific testing guidelines
   6.3. Document test data requirements and assumptions
   6.4. Provide examples for each test type and category

7. **Test Performance Optimization**
   7.1. Increase parallel test processes from 4 to 8
   7.2. Implement database seeding optimizations for tests
   7.3. Add selective test running capabilities
   7.4. Optimize test database configuration

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Achieving 100% test coverage for all plugins (focus is on quality over quantity)
2. Rewriting the entire testing framework (we will build on the existing structure)
3. End-to-end UI testing (will be addressed in a separate feature)
4. Performance testing of the application (will be addressed in a separate feature)
5. Testing third-party integrations (will be addressed in a separate feature)
6. Implementing automated security testing (will be addressed in a separate feature)

## Technical Considerations

1. The project uses Pest PHP built on top of PHPUnit as the primary testing framework
2. PHPUnit configuration is defined in `phpunit.xml`
3. Pest configuration is defined in `pest.config.php`
4. Tests are organized by type (Unit, Feature, Integration)
5. Plugin tests are further organized in subdirectories (e.g., `tests/Unit/Plugins/Accounts/`)
6. The Accounts plugin tests should be used as a reference for implementing tests for other plugins
7. Parallel testing is already enabled with 4 processes
8. Type coverage target is set to 95%

## Success Metrics

1. Increase in test coverage percentage (target: at least 50% of plugins have tests)
2. Reduction in bugs found in production (target: 30% reduction)
3. Faster test execution time despite more tests (target: no more than 25% increase in total test time)
4. Improved developer confidence when making changes (measured through developer surveys)
5. Reduction in time spent on manual testing (target: 40% reduction)
6. Increase in test-driven development adoption (measured through code review metrics)

## Open Questions

1. Should we prioritize certain plugins for testing based on business criticality?
2. What is the appropriate balance between unit, feature, and integration tests?
3. Should we consider adopting additional testing tools or frameworks?
4. How should we handle testing of legacy code that may be difficult to test?
5. What level of test coverage should we aim for in the long term?
6. How can we ensure that new developers follow the testing standards?
7. Should we implement automated test quality checks in the CI/CD pipeline?

## Responses to Open Questions

1. **Plugin Prioritization**: Not at this stage. The intention is to improve the whole testing framework across all plugins rather than prioritizing specific ones. This approach ensures a consistent testing methodology throughout the codebase.

2. **Test Type Balance**:
    1. Complete all unit tests and feature tests for each plugin to ensure comprehensive coverage of individual components and HTTP endpoints.
    2. Implement sufficient integration tests to ensure 100% of integrations with `core` plugins are tested, focusing on critical interaction points between components.

3. **Additional Testing Tools**:
    1. Yes, we should consider additional testing tools, but they MUST be compatible with Pest.
    2. **Decision**: Implement all the following additional testing tools as part of the improvement plan:
      - **Larastan**: Laravel-specific extension for PHPStan, providing static analysis tailored for Laravel applications
      - **Mockery**: For mocking objects in unit tests, fully compatible with Pest
      - **Infection PHP**: Mutation testing tool that helps identify weaknesses in test suites
      - **Laravel Dusk**: Browser testing tool for end-to-end testing of web applications

5. **Legacy Code Testing**: Ensure legacy code is brought up to date using Rector and then included in tests. This approach allows for modernizing the codebase while simultaneously improving test coverage.

6. **Long-term Coverage Target**: Aim for 90% test coverage immediately with a 100% long-term target. This ambitious but achievable goal ensures comprehensive protection against regressions while allowing for practical implementation.

7. **Testing Standards Adoption**:
    1. Document testing standards in `.junie/guidelines` to provide a central, accessible reference for all developers.
    2. Include automated test quality control in the commit process (with optional manual override) to enforce standards while maintaining flexibility for special cases.

8. **Automated Quality Checks**: Yes, implement automated test quality checks in the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures consistent test quality and prevents substandard tests from being merged into the codebase.
