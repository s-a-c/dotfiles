# 6. Event Sourcing & CQRS Architecture - Index

## 6.1 Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for implementing Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns as foundational architectural patterns for the UMS-STI system. The documentation covers event sourcing architecture, CQRS implementation, projectors and reactors, and strong consistency patterns.

## 6.2 Documentation Files

### 6.2.1 Foundation Architecture
- [010-event-sourcing-architecture.md](010-event-sourcing-architecture.md) ✅
  - Complete event sourcing design and implementation
  - Event store architecture with SQLite optimization
  - GDPR-compliant event management

### 6.2.2 CQRS Implementation
- [020-cqrs-implementation.md](020-cqrs-implementation.md) ✅
  - Command Query Responsibility Segregation patterns
  - Read/write model separation strategies
  - Performance optimization techniques

### 6.2.3 Event Processing
- [030-projectors-reactors.md](030-projectors-reactors.md) ✅
  - Event projectors for read model updates
  - Reactor patterns for side effects
  - Event handling and processing

### 6.2.4 Consistency Management
- [040-event-sourcing-with-strong-consistency.md](040-event-sourcing-with-strong-consistency.md) ✅
  - Strong consistency patterns in event sourcing
  - Conflict resolution strategies
  - Data integrity maintenance

## 6.3 Learning Path

For developers implementing event sourcing and CQRS, follow this recommended reading order:

1. **Event Sourcing Architecture** - Understand the foundation concepts
2. **CQRS Implementation** - Learn command and query separation
3. **Projectors and Reactors** - Implement event processing
4. **Strong Consistency** - Handle data integrity requirements

## 6.4 Prerequisites

- **Laravel 12.x** framework knowledge
- Understanding of event-driven architecture
- Familiarity with domain-driven design concepts
- Knowledge of SQLite optimization techniques
- Basic understanding of eventual consistency

## 6.5 Architecture Goals

The event sourcing implementation provides:

- **Auditability** - Complete event history for compliance and debugging
- **Scalability** - Separation of read/write operations for performance
- **Reliability** - Event replay capabilities for system recovery
- **Analytics** - Rich event data for business intelligence

## 6.6 Core Technologies

- **Event Store** - `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` as the foundation
- **Event Database** - Separate, exclusive SQLite database connection with WAL optimization
- **Event IDs** - Snowflake IDs using `glhd/bits` for distributed uniqueness
- **State Management** - Finite State Machines using spatie packages and enhanced PHP enums
- **Data Transfer** - DTOs and Value Objects for type safety
