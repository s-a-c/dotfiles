# Product Requirements Document: User Management System with Single Table Inheritance (UMS-STI)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The User Management System with Single Table Inheritance (UMS-STI) is a comprehensive user management solution designed to handle multiple user types within a single, scalable system. This system addresses the growing need for organizations to manage diverse user roles, team structures, and permissions while maintaining high performance and security standards.

**Problem Statement**: Organizations struggle with managing different types of users (customers, administrators, guests, system users) across complex team hierarchies while maintaining security, performance, and ease of administration.

**Solution**: A unified user management system that leverages Single Table Inheritance to efficiently store and manage multiple user types with distinct capabilities, integrated with modern team management and role-based access control.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Unified User Management**: Provide a single system to manage all user types with type-specific functionality
2. **Scalable Team Structure**: Support complex organizational hierarchies with explicit permission management
3. **Enhanced Security**: Implement role-based access control with non-inherited team permissions
4. **Administrative Efficiency**: Reduce administrative overhead through automated workflows and intuitive interfaces
5. **Developer Experience**: Provide a maintainable, well-documented system using modern PHP practices

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for user authentication and authorization
- **Scalability**: Support for 100,000+ users across 1,000+ teams
