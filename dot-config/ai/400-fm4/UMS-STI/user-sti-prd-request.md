# PRD Request: User Management System with Single Table Inheritance

Based on the comprehensive technical documentation available in `.ai/400-fm4/user-sti-implementation`, we need a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** that translates the technical implementation into business requirements and user stories.

## Context
The technical documentation covers a sophisticated User model implementation using Single Table Inheritance (STI) with modern Laravel 12.x and PHP 8.4+ features, including:

- **Core User Types**: Standard User, Admin, Guest, SystemUser
- **Advanced Features**: State management, teams hierarchy, roles & permissions
- **Modern Tech Stack**: FilamentPHP v4, Spatie packages, enhanced enums, ULID support
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Database design, testing strategy, best practices

## What We Need in the PRD

Please create a Product Requirements Document that includes:

### 1. **Executive Summary**
- Business problem this user management system solves
- Target market and user personas
- Key value propositions

### 2. **User Stories & Use Cases**
- Detailed user stories for each user type (Standard User, Admin, Guest, SystemUser)
- Team management workflows and hierarchical structures
- Permission and role management scenarios
- State transition use cases (active, inactive, suspended, etc.)

### 3. **Functional Requirements**
- User registration and authentication flows
- Profile management capabilities
- Team creation and management features
- Role assignment and permission controls
- Admin panel functionality requirements

### 4. **Business Rules & Logic**
- User type classification criteria
- Team hierarchy and permission inheritance rules
- State transition business logic
- SystemUser bypass mechanisms

### 5. **User Experience Requirements**
- FilamentPHP admin interface specifications
- User-facing features and interactions
- Mobile responsiveness requirements
- Accessibility considerations

### 6. **Integration Requirements**
- API specifications for different user types
- Third-party service integrations
- Authentication provider requirements

### 7. **Success Metrics & KPIs**
- User adoption metrics
- System performance benchmarks
- Security compliance measures
- Administrative efficiency gains

## Reference Documentation
Please base the PRD on the detailed technical specifications found in:
- `.ai/400-fm4/user-sti-implementation/000-index.md` (Overview)
- `.ai/400-fm4/user-sti-implementation/010-overview-and-architecture.md` (Architecture)
- All supporting implementation documents (020-130 series)

## Deliverable Format
- Professional PRD document suitable for stakeholder review
- Clear separation between business requirements and technical implementation
- Actionable user stories with acceptance criteria
- Priority levels for features (MVP, Phase 2, Future)

---

**Please create a comprehensive PRD that bridges the gap between our technical implementation capabilities and business value delivery.**

## Additional Context

### Technical Implementation Scope
The existing documentation covers:
- 13+ detailed implementation guides
