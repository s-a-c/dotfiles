# Architectural Patterns and Principles Summary

This document provides a consolidated summary of the architectural patterns, principles, and features found across the three research and development areas: Laravel Framework Skeleton (LFS), Large Scale Framework (LSF), and User Model Enhancements (UME).

## Common Architectural Patterns

### Event Sourcing and CQRS

Both LFS and LSF implement event sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns, providing:

- **Complete Audit Trail**: All state changes are recorded as events, enabling full historical tracking
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between read and write operations
- **Optimized Read Models**: Denormalized data structures for efficient querying
- **Business Logic Encapsulation**: Domain logic contained within aggregates
- **Replay Capability**: Ability to rebuild state from event history

**Implementation Approach**:
- Hybrid usage of `hirethunk/verbs` (modern PHP 8.4+ approach) and `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` (mature ecosystem)
- Event store optimized with Snowflake IDs for performance
- Projection strategy for efficient read models

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

All three projects incorporate DDD principles to varying degrees:

- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear domain boundaries
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between business and technical teams
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries and business rules
- **Domain Events**: Cross-aggregate communication
- **Value Objects**: Immutable data representation

### Finite State Machines

State management is implemented across all projects using:

- **PHP 8.4 Native Enums**: With backing types for type safety
- **Spatie Packages**: `spatie/laravel-model-states` for complex workflows and `spatie/laravel-model-status` for simple flags
- **Type-safe Transitions**: Controlled state changes with validation
- **Event-driven**: State changes trigger domain events

### Single Table Inheritance (STI)

Used in both LSF and UME for hierarchical models:

- **User Model** (UME): Base User class with specialized types (Admin, Customer, Guest)
- **Organisation Model** (LSF): Self-referential polymorphic design with materialized paths
- **Implementation**: Primarily using `tightenco/parental` package

## Core Technologies

### Backend Framework

- **PHP**: 8.4+
- **Laravel**: 12.x
- **FrankenPHP/Octane**: For high-performance PHP execution

### Database and Storage

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Identifier Strategy**: Multi-tier approach with auto-increment, Snowflake, UUID, and ULID
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage

### Frontend Technologies

- **Primary UI**: Livewire with Volt and Flux UI
- **JavaScript Support**: Alpine.js, Vue.js
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **Build System**: Vite 6.x

### Admin Interface

- **FilamentPHP**: Comprehensive admin panel with numerous plugins
- **Custom Themes**: Tailored admin experience

## Implementation Strategies

### Identifier Strategy

All projects implement a sophisticated identifier strategy:

- **Primary Keys**: Auto-incrementing integers for optimal database performance
- **Event Store**: Snowflake IDs for time-ordered, high-throughput event sourcing
- **External References**: ULID for URL-safe, time-ordered identifiers
- **Security Contexts**: UUID for maximum unpredictability

### Performance Optimization

Common performance strategies include:

- **Laravel Octane**: High-performance PHP execution
- **Event Batching**: Processing multiple events per transaction
- **Projection Snapshots**: Periodic state snapshots for fast rebuilds
- **Multi-layer Caching**: Redis-based caching strategy
- **Read/Write Splitting**: Database scaling through separation

### Security Architecture

Comprehensive security features across all projects:

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication, social login
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permission system with role-based and team-based controls
- **Data Protection**: Selective field encryption, input validation, output escaping
- **API Security**: Token-based authentication, rate limiting

## Integration Points

The three projects have natural integration points:

1. **LSF + UME**: The Large Scale Framework can incorporate User Model Enhancements for a comprehensive user management system within its multi-tenant organization model.

2. **LFS + UME**: The Laravel Framework Skeleton can use UME to enhance its user management capabilities with Single Table Inheritance and team hierarchies.

3. **LSF + LFS**: Both frameworks share common architectural patterns (event sourcing, CQRS, DDD) and could be combined for a complete enterprise solution.

## Recommended Adoption Strategy

For new projects, a phased adoption approach is recommended:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Start with core Laravel 12 setup and essential packages
2. **User Management Phase**: Implement UME for enhanced user models and authentication
3. **Domain Model Phase**: Add domain models with event sourcing and CQRS from LSF/LFS
4. **Advanced Features Phase**: Incorporate real-time features, admin interfaces, and search capabilities

This approach allows for incremental adoption of the architectural patterns and features while maintaining a working application throughout the development process.

## Conclusion

The three research and development areas (LFS, LSF, and UME) provide complementary architectural patterns, principles, and features for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Laravel applications. By understanding the strengths and focus areas of each, developers can select the appropriate components for their specific project requirements.
