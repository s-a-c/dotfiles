## Introduction

The Laravel Framework Skeleton (LFS) is a comprehensive Laravel application template designed to provide a solid foundation for building enterprise-grade applications. It incorporates modern architectural patterns and technologies to enable robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Event Sourcing and CQRS

LFS implements a hybrid event sourcing approach using both `hirethunk/verbs` and `spatie/laravel-event-sourcing` packages. This provides:

- Complete audit trail of all state changes
- Clear separation between read and write operations
- Ability to rebuild state from events
- Rich analytics and time-series analysis

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The application follows DDD principles with:

- Clear domain boundaries (bounded contexts)
- Aggregates for business logic encapsulation and consistency
- Domain events for cross-aggregate communication
- Value objects for immutable data representation

### Finite State Machines

State management is implemented using:

- PHP 8.4 native enums with backing types
- `spatie/laravel-model-states` for complex workflows
- `spatie/laravel-model-status` for simple flags

### Single Table Inheritance (STI)

Used for hierarchical models, particularly for the User model with:

- Base User class
- Specialized user types (Admin, Customer, Guest)
- Implemented using `tightenco/parental` package

## Core Technologies

### Backend Framework

- PHP 8.4+
- Laravel 12.x
- FrankenPHP for high-performance PHP execution

### Database and Storage

- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- Snowflake IDs for time-ordered, high-throughput event sourcing
- Multi-tier identifier strategy (auto-increment, Snowflake, UUID, ULID)

### Frontend Technologies

- Livewire with Volt for reactive components
- Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for asset bundling

### Admin Interface

- FilamentPHP for comprehensive admin panel
- Custom themes and plugins

## Feature Summary

LFS includes a wide range of features:

- **User Management**
  - Single Table Inheritance for different user types
  - Enhanced profiles with granular name components

  - Team membership by invitation

- **Authorization**
  - Role-based permissions
  - Team-based permissions
  - Comprehensive permission matrix

- **Real-time Features**
  - Presence detection
  - Notifications
  - Chat rooms (team, project, ad hoc)
  - WebSockets using Laravel Echo and Reverb

- **Content Management**
  - Blog system with lifecycle management
  - Categories and tags
  - Comments
  - Translatable models

- **Search**
  - Full-text search using Typesense
  - Faceted search
  - Real-time indexing

## Implementation Details

### Event Store Architecture

The event store is optimized with Snowflake IDs for performance and includes:

- Sequential IDs for performance
- UUID for external aggregate identifier
- Optimistic concurrency with version numbers
- JSON serialization for event data
- Metadata for context and tracing

### Projection Strategy

Read models are optimized for different use cases with:

- Denormalized data for fast reads
- Cached aggregations
- Automatic rebuilding from events

### Database Performance

Performance optimizations include:

- Hybrid identifier strategy for optimal performance
- Efficient time-based queries using Snowflake IDs
- Multi-layer caching with Redis
- Read/write splitting for database scaling

## Performance Considerations

LFS includes several performance optimizations:

- Laravel Octane with FrankenPHP for high-performance PHP execution
- Event batching for processing multiple events per transaction
- Projection snapshots for fast rebuilds
- Async processing for background event handling
- Stream partitioning for distributing events across multiple streams
- Event compression for reducing storage overhead

## Security Architecture

Security features include:

- Multi-factor authentication
- Complex permission system with Spatie
- Selective field encryption for sensitive data
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Rate limiting

## Scalability Design

LFS is designed for scalability with:

- Preparation for microservice architecture
- Read/write splitting for database scaling
- Performance monitoring with APM integration
- Horizontal scaling strategy
