## Security Architecture Framework

### Zero-Trust Security Model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Zero-Trust Architecture"
        A[User Request] --> B[Identity Verification]
        B --> C[Device Authentication]
        C --> D[Network Security]
        D --> E[Application Security]
        E --> F[Data Security]
        F --> G[Resource Access]
    end

    subgraph "Security Layers"
        H[Network Perimeter] --> I[Application Firewall]
        I --> J[API Gateway Security]
        J --> K[Service Mesh Security]
        K --> L[Database Security]
    end

    subgraph "Monitoring & Response"
        M[SIEM System] --> N[Threat Detection]
        N --> O[Automated Response]
        O --> P[Incident Management]
    end
```

### Security Principles

**Core Security Principles:**

1. **Least Privilege Access**: Grant minimum required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Fail Secure**: Default deny policies
4. **Continuous Verification**: Never trust, always verify
5. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Security Domains

| Domain                  | Components                       | Priority | Status         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Identity & Access       | OAuth 2.0, RBAC, MFA             | Critical | Implementation |
| Network Security        | TLS 1.3, VPN, Firewall           | Critical | Active         |
| Application Security    | OWASP Top 10, SAST, DAST         | High     | Planning       |
| Data Security           | Encryption, DLP, Backup          | Critical | Implementation |
| Infrastructure Security | Container Security, K8s Policies | High     | Planning       |

## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**MFA Implementation Strategy:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant M as MFA Provider
    participant R as Resource Server

    U->>A: Username/Password
    A->>M: Request MFA Challenge
    M->>U: Send Challenge (SMS/TOTP/Push)
    U->>M: Provide MFA Response
    M->>A: Validate Response
    A->>U: Issue JWT Token
    U->>R: Request with JWT
    R->>A: Validate Token
    A->>R: Token Valid
    R->>U: Provide Resource
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Role Hierarchy:**

```yaml
roles:
  super_admin:
    permissions: ['*']
    inheritance: []

  admin:
    permissions:
      - 'users.manage'
      - 'system.configure'
      - 'audit.view'
    inheritance: ['moderator']

  moderator:
    permissions:
      - 'content.moderate'
      - 'users.suspend'
      - 'reports.view'
    inheritance: ['user']

  user:
    permissions:
      - 'profile.read'
      - 'profile.write'
      - 'content.create'
    inheritance: []
```

### OAuth 2.0 Implementation

**OAuth Flow Configuration:**

- **Authorization Code Flow**: Web applications
- **PKCE Flow**: Mobile and SPA applications

        C --> D[Access]
        D --> E[Deletion]
    end

    subgraph "Privacy Controls"
        F[Consent Management] --> G[Data Minimization]
        G --> H[Purpose Limitation]
        H --> I[Retention Policies]
        I --> J[Right to Erasure]
    end

    subgraph "Technical Measures"
        K[Pseudonymization] --> L[Anonymization]
        L --> M[Data Masking]
        M --> N[Secure Deletion]
    end
```
