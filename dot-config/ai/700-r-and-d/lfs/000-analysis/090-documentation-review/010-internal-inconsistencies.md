+ PostgreSQL for development and production

# Month 1 implementation plan:
+ DB_CONNECTION_TESTING=sqlite
+ DB_DATABASE_TESTING=:memory:
+ Suggests file-based SQLite testing
```

**Impact:** 🟠 **Low** - Testing environment setup variations  
**Resolution Required:** Standardize testing database configuration
