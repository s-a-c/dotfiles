## Project Requirements Assessment

### 🎯 **Current Project State Analysis**

Based on analysis of existing setup and documentation:

#### **Existing Database Setup** (Confirmed via inspection)
```
Database: SQLite 3.x (86KB, active development database)
Location: /Users/s-a-c/Herd/lfs/database/database.sqlite
Tables: users, migrations, sessions, cache, jobs, failed_jobs
Configuration: Laravel default (DB_CONNECTION=sqlite)
Status: ✅ Operational with basic Laravel setup
```

#### **Documented Architectural Decisions**
- **Multi-tenancy**: Single database with PostgreSQL Row-Level Security ([AD-011](../060-decision-log.md))
- **Event Sourcing**: Selective approach using Spatie Event Sourcing ^7.11
- **Identifier Strategy**: Three-tier (Snowflake/UUID/ULID) - database agnostic
- **Performance Targets**: API < 200ms (95th percentile), 99.9% uptime

| **CI/CD Simplicity** | ✅ No external dependencies | ❌ Requires service containers | **SQLite** |

### **Operational Requirements**

| Factor | SQLite | PostgreSQL | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Backup Strategy** | ✅ Simple file copy | ✅ Enterprise backup tools | ✅ Both adequate |
| **Monitoring** | ⚠️ Limited native tools | ✅ Extensive monitoring | **PostgreSQL advantage** |
| **Scaling** | ❌ Single file limitation | ✅ Horizontal scaling | **PostgreSQL required for scale** |
| **Infrastructure Costs** | ✅ Zero additional cost | ❌ Hosting/management costs | **SQLite** |

## Constraint Analysis

### **Technical Constraints**

#### **SQLite Limitations** (Blocking factors)
1. **No Row-Level Security** - Required for documented multi-tenancy strategy
2. **Write Concurrency** - Limited to ~100 concurrent writes
3. **Database Size** - Performance degrades beyond ~1GB in practice
4. **Advanced Features** - No stored procedures, triggers limited

#### **PostgreSQL Complexities** (Development overhead)
1. **Infrastructure Setup** - Requires server management or cloud service
2. **Development Environment** - All developers need PostgreSQL setup
3. **Cost Implications** - Hosting costs from day one
4. **Operational Overhead** - Backup, monitoring, maintenance complexity

### **Business Constraints**

#### **Timeline Pressure** 
- **Phase 1 Deadline**: June-August 2025
- **MVP Requirements**: Fast iteration, minimal infrastructure
- **Development Velocity**: Priority for initial deployment

#### **Resource Constraints**
- **Team Familiarity**: Laravel developers comfortable with SQLite
- **Infrastructure Budget**: Early-stage project, cost optimization critical
- **Operational Capacity**: Limited DevOps resources for initial phase

#### **Future Growth Projections**
- **User Base**: Unknown scale, MVP validation required
- **Feature Complexity**: Multi-tenancy planned but not immediate
- **Performance Requirements**: Current targets achievable with SQLite

## Risk Assessment

### **SQLite First Approach Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Migration Complexity** | Medium | High | Comprehensive monitoring + clear triggers |
| **Performance Bottlenecks** | Medium | Medium | Proactive monitoring, clear thresholds |
| **Feature Limitations** | Low | Medium | Database-agnostic code design |
| **Scale Wall** | Low | High | Automated migration triggers |

### **PostgreSQL First Approach Risks**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Development Velocity** | High | Medium | Docker setup, team training |
| **Infrastructure Costs** | High | Low | Cloud provider credits, optimization |
| **Operational Complexity** | Medium | Medium | Managed services, monitoring setup |
| **Over-engineering** | Medium | Low | Phased feature implementation |

## Requirement Summary & Recommendation Input

### ✅ **SQLite Advantages for Current State**
1. **Perfect Development Experience** - Zero setup, fast testing, Laravel default
2. **Cost Optimization** - No infrastructure costs during MVP phase
3. **Deployment Simplicity** - Single file, no external dependencies
4. **Performance Adequacy** - Meets all current performance requirements

### ⚠️ **Known PostgreSQL Migration Drivers**
1. **Multi-tenancy Implementation** - Row-Level Security requirement documented
2. **Scale Requirements** - Above 100 concurrent users or 1GB data
3. **Advanced Features** - Complex querying, full-text search needs
4. **Enterprise Compliance** - Audit trails, advanced backup requirements

### 🎯 **Recommendation Direction**
**SQLite First with Monitored Migration Strategy** - Start with SQLite to maximize development velocity and minimize costs, with clear performance monitoring and automated migration triggers for PostgreSQL transition.
