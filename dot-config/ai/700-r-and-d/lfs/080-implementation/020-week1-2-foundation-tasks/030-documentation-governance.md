## 🤖 Automated Quality Gates

### **GitHub Actions Workflow: Documentation Quality Check**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/documentation-quality.yml
name: Documentation Quality Check

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.md'
      - '.github/lfs/**'
  
jobs:
  documentation-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Check Markdown Formatting
        uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-action@v1
        with:
          files: '**/*.md'
          config: '.markdownlint.json'

        with:
          use-quiet-mode: 'yes'
          
      - name: Verify Template Compliance
        run: |
          python .github/scripts/check-template-compliance.py
          
      - name: Check Cross-References
        run: |

      - name: Spelling Check
        uses: streetsidesoftware/cspell-action@v2
        with:
          files: '**/*.md'
```

### **Automated Consistency Rules**

#### **Naming Conventions**
- **File Names**: `kebab-case` with numerical prefixes for ordering
- **Document IDs**: Format `XXX-descriptive-name` (e.g., `001-stakeholder-communication`)
- **Headings**: Consistent hierarchy with emoji prefixes for visual scanning
- **Links**: Always use relative paths within project documentation

#### **Content Standards**
- **Architecture Decisions**: Must include rationale, alternatives considered, implications
- **Configuration Guides**: Must include examples, common issues, validation steps
- **API Documentation**: Must include request/response examples, error codes
- **Troubleshooting**: Must include symptoms, diagnosis steps, solutions
