## Context & Background

I'm working on a Laravel application modernization project with extensive planning documentation already completed. The
project follows strict documentation standards and is designed for highly visual learners.

## Assignment Requirements

**Primary Objective:** Create a comprehensive, detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for Phase 1 of our
modernization roadmap, designed as a learning-by-doing experience for students.

## Key Reference Documents

- **Analysis Framework**: `.github/lfs/000-analysis/` folder contains 9 completed analysis documents
- **Implementation Roadmap**: `.github/lfs/080-implementation-roadmap.md` defines Phase 1 as "Foundation & Assessment"
  (3 months)
- **Standards Guide**: `.copilot/instructions.md` contains mandatory formatting and documentation standards

## Phase 1 Scope (from roadmap)

**Duration**: 3 months  
**Focus**: Foundation & Security  
**Investment**: $150K  
**Expected ROI**: Risk reduction, compliance

**Month 1**: Infrastructure & Planning

- Project initiation and team assembly
- Infrastructure foundation setup
- CI/CD pipeline implementation

**Month 2**: Security & Monitoring

- OAuth 2.0 and RBAC implementation
- Security scanning integration
- ELK stack deployment
- Prometheus/Grafana setup

**Month 3**: Testing & Validation

- Test automation expansion
- Performance and security testing
- Documentation completion
- Phase validation and go/no-go decision

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Implementation Plan Document

**Location**: `.github/lfs/080-implementation/010-phase-1/010-implementation-plan.md`

**Must Include**:

- Detailed step-by-step instructions for ALL installations, configurations, builds, and tests
- Specific commands for macOS/zsh environment
- Complete configuration files and code examples
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- References and citations to official documentation sources
- Learning objectives for each section

### 2. Progress Tracker Document

**Location**: `.github/lfs/080-implementation/010-phase-1/020-progress-tracker.md`

**Must Include**:

- Color-coded visual progress tracking system
- Percentage completion tracking for each task
- Overall phase completion percentage
- Status indicators (not started, in progress, completed, blocked)
- Time estimates and actual time tracking
- Dependencies and prerequisite mapping

### 3. Decision Log Document

**Location**: `.github/lfs/080-implementation/010-phase-1/030-decision-log.md`

**Must Include**:

- Documentation of all decisions made during planning
- Questions that arise and their resolutions
- Inconsistencies found and how they were addressed
- Confidence scores (%) for each decision with explanations
- Alternative options considered and rejection rationale

### 4. Index Document

**Location**: `.github/lfs/080-implementation/010-phase-1/000-index.md`

**Must Include**:

- Navigation to all documents in the implementation folder
- Cross-references to analysis documents
- Quick reference guide for students

## Mandatory Standards Compliance

### Documentation Standards

- **Hierarchical numbering**: All headings numbered sequentially (1, 1.1, 1.1.1)
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case with 3-digit prefixes
- **Color coding**: Use high-contrast colors meeting WCAG AA standards
- **Code blocks**: Use proper language specifications and dark containers for colored backgrounds
- **Accessibility**: Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text

### Visual Requirements

- **Target audience**: Highly visual learners
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Extensive use with high-contrast themes
- **Color categories**:
  - Documentation Index: `#0066cc` (blue)
  - Implementation Planning: `#222` (dark gray)
  - Success indicators: `#007700` (green)
  - Warning indicators: `#cc7700` (orange)

### Content Requirements

- **Command verification**: All commands must be verified against official documentation
- **Citations**: Include direct links to official documentation
- **Learning focus**: Design for students learning by doing
- **Troubleshooting**: Include common error scenarios and solutions

### Git Workflow Standards

- **Commit messages**: 50 character max summary, imperative mood
- **Multi-line format**: Use multiple -m flags with line continuation
- **Versioning**: Include semantic version tag suggestions

## Success Criteria Validation

Ensure the implementation plan addresses all Phase 1 success criteria:

- âœ… 99.9% system uptime maintained during implementation
- âœ… Security vulnerabilities reduced by 80%
- âœ… Deployment time reduced by 50%
- âœ… Test coverage increased to 80%
- âœ… All compliance requirements met

## Additional Context

- **Current environment**: macOS with zsh shell
- **Base application**: Laravel with standard MVC structure
- **Infrastructure target**: Cloud-native with AWS/Azure options
- **Security focus**: OAuth 2.0, RBAC, encryption, compliance
- **Monitoring stack**: ELK, Prometheus, Grafana

## Expected Approach

1. **Review existing analysis documents** to understand current state and requirements
2. **Create folder structure** following the specified naming conventions
3. **Develop detailed implementation steps** with specific commands and configurations
4. **Design visual progress tracking** with percentage completion metrics
5. **Document decisions and rationale** with confidence scores
6. **Validate against success criteria** and ensure learning objectives are met

**Confidence Level Required**: Each recommendation should include a confidence percentage with explanation.

**Target Completion**: Ready-to-execute implementation plan that a student could follow step-by-step to successfully
complete Phase 1.

**Use smaller chunks**: Break down the implementation into manageable tasks with clear dependencies. **Use smaller
files**: Each document should be concise, focused, and easy to navigate. **Remain within the capacity of your tools**:
Ensure all commands and configurations are executable in the specified environment.

## Usage Instructions

This prompt is designed to be copy-pasted into a new AI assistant chat window. The AI will have access to the referenced
documents and will create comprehensive implementation documentation following all specified standards and requirements.

**Key Benefits of This Improved Prompt:**

âœ… **Clear context and objectives**  
âœ… **Specific deliverable requirements**  
âœ… **Mandatory standards compliance**  
âœ… **Success criteria validation**  
âœ… **Learning-focused approach**  
âœ… **Detailed formatting requirements**  
âœ… **Reference to all key documents**  
âœ… **Ready for copy-paste use**

The prompt eliminates ambiguity and ensures the AI assistant will create comprehensive, standards-compliant
documentation that serves as both an implementation guide and learning resource.
