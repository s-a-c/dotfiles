# Implementation

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This section contains the step-by-step implementation of the User Model Enhancements (UME) features. Each phase builds upon the previous one, resulting in a working application with a complete test suite.

## Phases

The implementation is divided into the following phases:

1. [Phase 0: Foundation](./010-phase0-foundation/000-index.md) - Setting up the Laravel 12 project, installing packages, and configuring the environment.
2. [Phase 1: Core Models & STI](./020-phase1-core-models/000-index.md) - Implementing Single Table Inheritance for the User model.
3. [Phase 2: Auth & Profiles](./030-phase2-auth-profile/000-index.md) - Enhancing authentication and user profiles.
4. [Phase 3: Teams & Permissions](./040-phase3-teams-permissions/000-index.md) - Implementing teams and role-based permissions.
5. [Phase 4: Real-time Foundation](./050-phase4-realtime/000-index.md) - Setting up WebSockets and real-time features.
6. [Phase 5: Advanced Features](./060-phase5-advanced/000-index.md) - Adding advanced features like impersonation, comments, and search.
7. [Phase 6: Polishing & Deployment](./070-phase6-polishing/000-index.md) - Finalizing the application with internationalization, testing, and deployment preparation.

## Implementation Approach

Each implementation step follows this structure:

1. **Goal**: What you'll accomplish in this step
2. **Prerequisites**: What needs to be in place before starting
3. **Implementation**: Step-by-step instructions
4. **Verification**: How to test that the step was completed successfully
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
6. **Next Steps**: What to do after completing this step

## UI Implementation

For each UI component, we provide implementations using:

1. **Livewire/Volt with Flux UI** (Primary Path)
2. **FilamentPHP** (Admin Interface)
3. **Inertia.js with React** (Alternative Path)
4. **Inertia.js with Vue** (Alternative Path)

UI components are integrated within each phase of the implementation, with specific documentation on how to use and extend them.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Phase 0: Foundation](./010-phase0-foundation/000-index.md) to set up your Laravel 12 project and install the necessary packages.
