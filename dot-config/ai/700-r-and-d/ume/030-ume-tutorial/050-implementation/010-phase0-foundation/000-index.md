## Overview

Phase 0 is all about setting up the foundation for our User Model Enhancements (UME) project. We'll create a new Laravel 12 project, configure the environment, install necessary packages, and set up the basic structure of the application.

This phase is crucial as it ensures that we have a solid foundation to build upon in the subsequent phases. We'll be using the latest features of PHP 8.4 and Laravel 12, and we'll be setting up tools like FilamentPHP for the admin panel and Flux UI for the frontend.

By the end of this phase, you'll have a fully configured Laravel 12 project ready for implementing the core models and features of the UME tutorial.
