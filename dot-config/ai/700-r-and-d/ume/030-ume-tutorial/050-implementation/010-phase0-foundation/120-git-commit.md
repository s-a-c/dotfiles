# First Git Commit

After completing the foundation setup for our UME project, it's time to commit our changes to Git. This will create a baseline that we can refer back to if needed and mark the completion of Phase 0.

## Reviewing Changes

Before committing, let's review what we've accomplished in Phase 0:

1. Created a new Laravel 12 project with Livewire Starter Kit
2. Configured the environment
3. Installed FilamentPHP for the admin panel
4. Installed core backend packages including Parental for STI
5. Published package configurations and ran migrations
6. Set up PHP 8 attributes
7. Configured Laravel Pulse access
8. Installed and configured Flux UI components
9. Set up the UI framework

## Committing Changes

Now, let's commit these changes to Git:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize Git repository if not already done
git init

# Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# Create the initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Phase 0 Foundation" \
-m "Completed the foundation setup for the UME project:" \
-m "- Created Laravel 12 project with Livewire" \
-m "- Configured environment" \
-m "- Installed FilamentPHP admin panel" \
-m "- Added core packages including Parental for STI" \
-m "- Published configurations and ran migrations" \
-m "- Set up PHP 8 attributes" \
-m "- Configured Laravel Pulse" \
-m "- Installed Flux UI components" \
-m "- Configured UI framework"
```

## Creating a Branch for Phase 1

Before moving on to Phase 1, let's create a new branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for Phase 1
git checkout -b phase1-core-models
```

This allows us to keep the foundation phase separate from the core models phase, making it easier to track changes and revert if necessary.

## Next Steps

With our foundation in place and our changes committed to Git, we're ready to move on to [Phase 1: Core Models & STI](../020-phase1-core-models/000-index.md), where we'll implement Single Table Inheritance and create our core models.
