# Phase 4 Git Commit

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../assets/css/styles.css">

## Goal

Commit all the changes we've made in Phase 4 to Git, ensuring we have a clean snapshot of our work on real-time features and activity logging.

## Prerequisites

- Completed all the previous sections in Phase 4
- Git installed and initialized in your project

## Implementation

### Step 1: Review Changes

Before committing, let's review what we've done in Phase 4:

1. Set up Laravel Reverb for WebSocket communication
2. Configured Laravel Echo for frontend real-time updates
3. Implemented the User Presence State Machine:
   - Created the `PresenceStatus` enum
   - Added database fields for presence status
   - Created the `PresenceChanged` broadcast event
   - Implemented login/logout listeners
   - Created a service for managing presence
4. Implemented activity logging for presence changes
5. Created UI components for displaying presence indicators
6. Implemented a real-time chat feature

Let's check the status of our Git repository:

```bash
git status
```

### Step 2: Stage Changes

Stage all the changes we've made:

```bash
git add .
```

Alternatively, you can stage specific files if you want to create multiple commits:

```bash
# Stage Reverb and Echo configuration
git add config/reverb.php
git add resources/js/bootstrap.js

# Stage Presence Status implementation
git add app/Enums/PresenceStatus.php
git add database/migrations/*_add_presence_status_to_users_table.php

# Stage Events and Listeners
git add app/Events/User/PresenceChanged.php
git add app/Listeners/Auth/UpdatePresenceOnLogin.php
git add app/Listeners/Auth/UpdatePresenceOnLogout.php
git add app/Listeners/User/LogPresenceActivity.php

# Stage Services and Controllers
git add app/Services/PresenceService.php
git add app/Http/Controllers/PresenceController.php
git add app/Http/Controllers/ActivityLogController.php

# Stage JavaScript
git add resources/js/presence.js
git add resources/js/app.js

# Stage Views
git add resources/views/activity-log/
git add resources/views/livewire/teams/

# Stage Routes
git add routes/web.php
git add routes/channels.php
```

### Step 3: Create a Commit

Create a commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Phase 4: Implement real-time features and activity logging

- Set up Laravel Reverb and Echo
- Implement User Presence State Machine with PresenceStatus enum
- Create PresenceChanged broadcast event
- Add login/logout listeners for automatic status updates
- Implement activity logging for presence changes
- Create UI components for presence indicators and chat
- Add activity log views for users and teams"
```

### Step 4: Push Changes (Optional)

If you're using a remote repository, push your changes:

```bash
git push origin main  # Or your current branch name
```

## Best Practices for Git Commits

When making commits, follow these best practices:

1. **Make Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Include a brief summary and detailed description
3. **Use Present Tense**: Write commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
4. **Reference Issues**: If using an issue tracker, reference issue numbers in commit messages
5. **Verify Before Committing**: Review changes with `git diff --staged` before committing

## Git Workflow for Future Development

As you continue developing the UME application, consider adopting a more structured Git workflow:

### Feature Branch Workflow

1. Create a branch for each new feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-presence
```

2. Make changes and commit them to the feature branch
3. Push the feature branch to the remote repository
4. Create a pull request for code review
5. Merge the feature branch into the main branch after approval

### Git Hooks

Consider setting up Git hooks to automate tasks:

1. **pre-commit**: Run tests and linters before allowing commits
2. **pre-push**: Run more comprehensive tests before pushing
3. **post-merge**: Update dependencies after pulling changes

You can create these hooks in the `.git/hooks` directory or use a tool like Husky for JavaScript-based hooks.

## Verification

To verify your commit:

1. Check the commit history:

```bash
git log -1
```

2. Verify that all changes were included:

```bash
git show --name-status HEAD
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed Phase 4 of the UME tutorial. You've implemented real-time features including the User Presence State Machine and activity logging.

In the next phase, we'll implement advanced features and polish the application:

- Implement impersonation
- Add comments functionality
- Implement user settings
- Set up full-text search
- Enhance the real-time features
