## Polishing Your Application

In this final phase, we'll add the finishing touches to make your application production-ready:

1. **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages for a global audience
2. **Feature Flags**: Safely roll out new features to subsets of users
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure reliability with unit, feature, and browser tests
4. **Performance Optimization**: Make your application fast and efficient
5. **Documentation**: Create clear documentation for users and developers
6. **Data Backups**: Protect your data with automated backups
7. **Deployment Preparation**: Get ready for production deployment

## Flux UI for Polishing

We'll use several Flux UI components to enhance the user experience:

- Language selector dropdown
- Feature flag toggles
- Settings pages
- Documentation components
- Status indicators
- Toast notifications for system messages

Let's begin by [Understanding Internationalization (i18n)](./020-understanding-i18n.md).
