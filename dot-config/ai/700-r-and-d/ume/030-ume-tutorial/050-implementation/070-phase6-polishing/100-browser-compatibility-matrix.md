## Operating System Matrix

| Feature | Windows 10/11 | macOS (Latest) | iOS (Latest) | Android (Latest) | Linux (Ubuntu) | Notes |
|---------|---------------|----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|-------|

| Performance | | | | | | |
| Browser compatibility | | | | | | |

## Testing Procedure

1. For each browser/device combination:
   - Use the actual device when possible
   - Use browser developer tools for simulating devices when necessary
   - Use BrowserStack or similar services for devices not physically available

2. For each feature:
   - ✅ = Works as expected
   - ⚠️ = Minor issues (document in notes)
   - ❌ = Major issues (document in notes)
   - N/A = Not applicable

3. Document specific issues:
   - Screenshot or screen recording
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Browser version and OS details
   - Severity assessment
   - Potential workarounds

## Priority Matrix

| Browser/Device | Priority | Testing Frequency | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Chrome Desktop | P0 | Every change | Most common browser |
| Firefox Desktop | P0 | Every change | |
| Safari Desktop | P1 | Major changes | |
| Edge Desktop | P1 | Major changes | |
| Chrome Mobile | P0 | Every change | Most common mobile browser |
| Safari iOS | P0 | Every change | All iOS browsers use Safari engine |
| Samsung Internet | P2 | Quarterly | Popular on Samsung devices |
| Firefox Mobile | P2 | Quarterly | |
| Tablets | P1 | Major changes | |
| Large screens | P2 | Quarterly | |
| Small screens | P1 | Major changes | |

## Automated Testing

The following automated tests should be run regularly:

1. **Cross-browser visual regression testing**
   - Tool: Percy, Applitools, or similar
   - Frequency: Weekly or after significant changes
   - Coverage: All major page templates

2. **Accessibility testing**
   - Tool: Axe, WAVE, or similar
   - Frequency: Weekly or after significant changes
   - Coverage: All major page templates

3. **Performance testing**
   - Tool: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
   - Frequency: Monthly or after significant changes
   - Coverage: Key user journeys

## Issue Resolution Process

1. **Triage**
   - Assess severity and impact
   - Determine if browser-specific or general issue
   - Assign priority based on affected users

2. **Resolution Approaches**
   - Fix core issue when possible
   - Implement graceful degradation for browser-specific issues
   - Document known limitations when necessary

3. **Verification**
   - Retest on affected browsers/devices
   - Verify fix doesn't introduce new issues
   - Update compatibility matrix

## Compatibility Statement

Based on testing results, maintain an up-to-date compatibility statement for users that includes:

- Fully supported browsers and versions
- Partially supported browsers with limitations
- Unsupported browsers
- Recommended browser settings
- Known issues and workarounds
