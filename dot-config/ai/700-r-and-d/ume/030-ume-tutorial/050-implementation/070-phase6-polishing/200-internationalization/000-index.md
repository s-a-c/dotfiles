## Why Internationalization Matters

Internationalization is essential for applications that aim to reach a global audience. By supporting multiple languages and regional settings, you can:

- **Expand Your User Base**: Reach users who speak different languages
- **Improve User Experience**: Users prefer applications in their native language
- **Meet Legal Requirements**: Some regions require applications to be available in local languages
- **Demonstrate Inclusivity**: Show that you value users from different cultures and backgrounds
