## How to Use These Exercises

Each exercise file contains multiple sets of questions and practical exercises. The questions test your theoretical understanding, while the practical exercises challenge you to apply what you've learned.

To get the most out of these exercises:

1. Complete the corresponding tutorial section first
2. Try to answer the questions without looking at the answers
3. Implement the practical exercises on your own
4. Check your answers against the [sample answers](../070-sample-answers/) directory
5. Revisit any concepts you struggled with

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise set typically includes:

1. **Multiple-choice questions** - Testing theoretical knowledge
2. **Practical exercises** - Applying concepts in code
3. **Additional resources** - Links to relevant documentation

## Answers

Sample answers to all exercises can be found in the [sample answers directory](../070-sample-answers/).

**Note:** Some of the more complex exercise answers (particularly for state machines) are split into multiple files to make them easier to read and navigate. The sample answers index provides links to all parts of these split answers.
