### Exercise

**Create a diagram that illustrates the relationship between the different user types in the UME tutorial.**

Using a tool of your choice (draw.io, Mermaid, or even pen and paper), create a class diagram that shows:
- The base User model
- The child models (Admin, Manager, Practitioner)
- The inheritance relationships between them
- At least two attributes and one method for each model

## Set 2: Understanding the Tutorial Structure

### Questions

1. **What is the purpose of breaking the UME tutorial into phases?**

   - B) To create artificial complexity
   - C) To provide bite-sized, incremental steps with working code at each stage
   - D) To separate frontend and backend development completely

2. **Why does the UME tutorial provide multiple UI implementation approaches?**
   - A) To confuse beginners
   - B) To accommodate different team skills and project requirements
   - C) To increase the page count of the tutorial
   - D) Because the primary approach is deprecated

3. **What is the relationship between Laravel Fortify and Livewire in the UME tutorial?**
   - A) They are competing technologies that cannot be used together
   - B) Fortify provides backend authentication logic while Livewire provides the UI
   - C) Fortify is a frontend framework and Livewire is a backend framework
   - D) They are unrelated and used for different purposes

4. **Which of the following is NOT a real-time feature implemented in the UME tutorial?**

   - B) Real-time chat system
   - C) Real-time notifications
   - D) Real-time video conferencing

### Exercise

**Create a learning roadmap for the UME tutorial.**

Create a simple roadmap or checklist that outlines:
- The prerequisites you need to learn before starting the tutorial
- The order in which you would tackle the different phases
- Estimated time commitments for each phase
- Key learning outcomes for each phase

This roadmap should help a beginner understand how to approach the tutorial effectively.

## Exercise 3: Understanding User Models in Laravel

### Questions

1. **What are the core interfaces implemented by the standard Laravel User model?**
   - A) Authenticatable, MustVerifyEmail, CanResetPassword
   - B) Authenticatable, Authorizable, Notifiable
   - C) Authenticatable, Notifiable, HasFactory
   - D) Authenticatable, HasRoles, HasPermissions

2. **Which of the following is NOT typically a fillable attribute in the base Laravel User model?**
   - A) name
   - B) email
   - C) password
   - D) remember_token

3. **What is the purpose of the 'hidden' attributes in the User model?**
   - A) To encrypt data in the database
   - B) To prevent attributes from being serialized to JSON/arrays
   - C) To make attributes invisible in the database
   - D) To mark attributes as deprecated

4. **How does Laravel's authentication system interact with the User model?**
   - A) It doesn't; authentication is handled separately
   - B) It uses the User model for login, registration, and password resets
   - C) It only uses the User model for API authentication
   - D) It bypasses the User model and works directly with the database

### Exercise

**Examine a basic Laravel User model and document its components and functionality.**

1. Create a new Laravel project (or use an existing one)
2. Examine the default User model
3. Document the following:
   - The model's inheritance hierarchy
   - All traits used by the model
   - All fillable, hidden, and cast attributes
   - How the model interacts with Laravel's authentication system
   - Any relationships defined on the model

Present your findings in a structured document with code examples.

## Exercise 4: Exploring Enhancement Opportunities

### Questions

1. **Which of the following is NOT a common enhancement to the User model?**
   - A) Adding profile fields like first_name, last_name, bio
   - B) Implementing avatar management
   - C) Adding social authentication integration
   - D) Implementing database sharding

2. **What is a benefit of using a package like Spatie MediaLibrary for avatar management?**
   - A) It's the only way to store images in Laravel
   - B) It provides automatic resizing, format conversion, and storage optimization
   - C) It's required for user authentication
   - D) It's faster than storing image paths in the database

3. **What is a common approach for implementing user status management?**
   - A) Creating a separate status table with a one-to-many relationship
   - B) Using a status field with predefined states
   - C) Storing status information in the session
   - D) Using a third-party service for status tracking

4. **Which enhancement would be most useful for security monitoring?**
   - A) Adding social authentication
   - B) Implementing avatar management
   - C) Adding tracking metadata like last_login_at and last_login_ip
   - D) Adding profile fields

### Exercise

**Identify potential enhancements to the base Laravel User model and explain their benefits.**

1. Research at least five potential enhancements to the Laravel User model
2. For each enhancement:
   - Describe the implementation approach
   - Explain the benefits it provides
   - Outline any technical considerations or challenges
   - Provide a code example of how it would be implemented
3. Prioritize the enhancements based on their value and implementation complexity

Present your findings in a structured document with code examples and justifications for your prioritization.

## Exercise 5: Planning a Model Enhancement Strategy

### Questions

1. **What is the first step in enhancing a User model in a production application?**
   - A) Writing migrations immediately
   - B) Assessment and analysis of current structure and usage
   - C) Deploying changes directly to production
   - D) Rewriting the entire authentication system

2. **Why is it important to create backward-compatible migrations?**
   - A) To make the code more complex
   - B) To allow for rollback if issues occur
   - C) It's not important; breaking changes are acceptable
   - D) To support multiple database systems

3. **What testing approach is recommended before deploying User model changes?**
   - A) No testing is necessary for model changes
   - B) Only unit testing is required
   - C) Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and performance tests
   - D) Manual testing in production

4. **What is a recommended approach when adding new fields to the User model?**
   - A) Make all new fields required immediately
   - B) Add fields as nullable initially and populate data before making them required
   - C) Create a completely new User model and table
   - D) Always use separate tables for new fields

### Exercise

**Plan a step-by-step approach for enhancing the User model in a production application.**

1. Choose a specific enhancement scenario (e.g., adding name components, implementing status management)
2. Create a detailed implementation plan that includes:
   - Assessment phase activities
   - Planning phase deliverables
   - Development steps with code examples
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment approach with considerations for minimizing disruption
   - Post-deployment verification and monitoring
3. Include a rollback plan in case issues arise
4. Provide a timeline estimate for each phase

Present your plan in a structured document that could be used as a guide for implementing the enhancement in a real-world scenario.
