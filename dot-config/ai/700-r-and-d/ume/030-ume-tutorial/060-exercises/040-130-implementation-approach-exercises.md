# Implementation Approach Exercises

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of the overall implementation approach in the UME tutorial. Each set contains questions and a practical exercise.

## Set 1: Understanding Implementation Phases

### Questions

1. **What is the purpose of Phase 0 in the UME tutorial?**
   - A) To teach basic PHP syntax
   - B) To set up the Laravel 12 project, install packages, and configure the environment
   - C) To design the database schema
   - D) To create wireframes for the UI

2. **Which phase implements Single Table Inheritance for the User model?**
   - A) Phase 0: Foundation
   - B) Phase 1: Core Models & STI
   - C) Phase 2: Auth & Profiles
   - D) Phase 3: Teams & Permissions

3. **What is the relationship between Phase 2 (Auth & Profiles) and Phase 3 (Teams & Permissions)?**
   - A) They are completely independent
   - B) Phase 3 depends on Phase 2
   - C) Phase 2 depends on Phase 3
   - D) They must be implemented simultaneously

4. **What is the final phase of the UME tutorial?**
   - A) Phase 5: Advanced Features
   - B) Phase 6: Polishing
   - C) Phase 7: Deployment
   - D) Phase 8: Maintenance

### Exercise

**Create a dependency graph for the implementation phases.**

Create a diagram that shows the dependencies between the different implementation phases:
- Which phases depend on which other phases
- What key components are built in each phase
- How the components interact across phases

This should help visualize the overall architecture and implementation flow of the UME tutorial.

## Set 2: Understanding Implementation Approach

### Questions

1. **What structure does each implementation step follow in the UME tutorial?**
   - A) Code, explanation, verification
   - B) Goal, prerequisites, implementation, verification, troubleshooting, next steps
   - C) Theory, practice, assessment
   - D) Problem, solution, discussion

2. **What testing strategy is used in the UME tutorial?**
   - A) No testing is included
   - B) Only unit tests
   - C) Only end-to-end tests
   - D) Unit tests, feature tests, and browser tests

3. **What is the recommended Git workflow in the UME tutorial?**
   - A) Commit after each line of code
   - B) Commit after completing each major milestone
   - C) Commit only at the end of each phase
   - D) No Git workflow is recommended

4. **Which UI framework is used for the admin interface in the UME tutorial?**
   - A) Livewire with Flux UI
   - B) Inertia.js with React
   - C) FilamentPHP
   - D) Blade templates with Bootstrap

### Exercise

**Design your own implementation approach for a feature.**

Choose a feature not covered in the UME tutorial (e.g., a subscription system, a content management system, or a marketplace) and design an implementation approach following the UME tutorial's structure:

1. Break down the feature into phases
2. For each phase:
   - Define the goals
   - List the prerequisites
   - Outline the implementation steps
   - Describe how to verify the implementation
   - Identify potential troubleshooting points
   - Define the next steps
3. Create a timeline for the implementation
4. Identify the key components and their interactions
5. Define the testing strategy
6. Outline the Git workflow

Present your implementation approach in a structured document similar to the UME tutorial.
