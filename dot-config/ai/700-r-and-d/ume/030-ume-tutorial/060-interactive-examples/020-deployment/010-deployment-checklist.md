- [ ] No critical bugs remain open
- [ ] Code meets security standards
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets

### Documentation
- [ ] System documentation is complete
- [ ] API documentation is complete
- [ ] User guide is complete
- [ ] Deployment guide is complete
- [ ] Maintenance guide is complete

### Environment
- [ ] Production server meets system requirements
- [ ] Database is configured and optimized
- [ ] Redis is configured for caching
- [ ] SSL certificates are installed and valid
- [ ] Firewall rules are configured
- [ ] Backup system is in place
- [ ] Monitoring system is configured

### Security

- [ ] Vulnerability scanning has been performed
- [ ] Content Security Policy is configured
- [ ] CORS settings are appropriate
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Input validation is thorough
- [ ] Output sanitization is implemented

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backup
- [ ] Create a full backup of the production database
- [ ] Create a backup of all application files
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### 2. Maintenance Mode
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Notify users of upcoming maintenance
- [ ] Enable maintenance mode

### 3. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy code to production server
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Build frontend assets
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Clear and rebuild caches
- [ ] Update configuration files
- [ ] Restart services

### 4. Verification
- [ ] Verify application is running
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Check critical functionality
- [ ] Verify API endpoints
- [ ] Check for errors in logs
- [ ] Verify monitoring is working
- [ ] Check performance metrics

### 5. Go Live
- [ ] Disable maintenance mode
- [ ] Verify application is accessible
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Be prepared for rollback if necessary

## Post-Deployment Checks

### Functionality
- [ ] Interactive examples load correctly
- [ ] Code execution works
- [ ] Monaco editor functions properly
- [ ] Local storage persistence works
- [ ] All buttons and controls function
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### Performance
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] API response times are acceptable
- [ ] Resource usage is within limits
- [ ] No memory leaks are detected
- [ ] No CPU spikes are observed

### Security
- [ ] No unauthorized access is possible
- [ ] Rate limiting is effective
- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed
- [ ] Sandbox isolation is effective

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error logging is working
- [ ] Performance monitoring is active
- [ ] User activity is being tracked
- [ ] Alerts are configured
- [ ] Dashboard is accessible

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered after deployment:

### 1. Assess the Issue
- [ ] Determine severity and impact
- [ ] Decide if rollback is necessary
- [ ] Document the issue

### 2. Initiate Rollback
- [ ] Enable maintenance mode
- [ ] Restore code from backup
- [ ] Restore database if necessary
- [ ] Verify rollback was successful

### 3. Post-Rollback
- [ ] Disable maintenance mode
- [ ] Notify users of the issue
- [ ] Investigate root cause
- [ ] Develop fix for next deployment
