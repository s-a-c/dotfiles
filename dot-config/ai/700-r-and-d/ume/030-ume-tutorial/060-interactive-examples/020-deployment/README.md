# Deployment Resources for Interactive Examples

This directory contains resources for deploying the interactive examples system to production.

## Contents

- [Deployment Checklist](010-deployment-checklist.md): A comprehensive checklist to ensure a smooth deployment
- [Deployment Schedule](020-deployment-schedule.md): The timeline for deploying the system to production
- [Monitoring Plan](030-monitoring-plan.md): Strategy for monitoring the system after deployment
- [Metrics Collection Plan](040-metrics-collection-plan.md): Plan for collecting usage metrics
- [Deployment Script](050-deployment-script.sh): Script for automating the deployment process
- [Rollback Script](060-rollback-script.sh): Script for rolling back to a previous version if needed

## Deployment Process

The deployment process consists of the following steps:

1. **Pre-Deployment**
   - Complete all items in the deployment checklist
   - Schedule the deployment according to the deployment schedule
   - Notify users of the upcoming maintenance window

2. **Deployment**
   - Create backups of the current system
   - Enable maintenance mode
   - Deploy the new code
   - Run database migrations
   - Clear and rebuild caches
   - Verify the deployment
   - Disable maintenance mode

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - Monitor the system for issues
   - Collect usage metrics
   - Notify users of the completed maintenance

## Rollback Process

If issues are discovered after deployment, the rollback process can be used to restore the system to its previous state:

1. **Assessment**
   - Determine if a rollback is necessary
   - Document the issues encountered

2. **Rollback**
   - Enable maintenance mode
   - Restore code from backup
   - Restore database from backup
   - Clear and rebuild caches
   - Verify the rollback
   - Disable maintenance mode

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - Notify users of the rollback
   - Investigate the root cause of the issues
   - Develop a plan to address the issues

## Monitoring

After deployment, the system should be monitored according to the monitoring plan:

1. **System Health**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk space
   - Load average

2. **Application Performance**
   - Response time
   - Error rate
   - Request rate
   - Queue length

3. **User Experience**
   - Page load time
   - Editor load time
   - Code execution time
   - Error count

4. **Security**
   - Failed login attempts
   - Rate limit hits
   - Suspicious code executions
   - Security scan results

## Metrics Collection

Usage metrics should be collected according to the metrics collection plan:

1. **User Engagement**
   - Page views
   - Example interactions
   - Time on example
   - Scroll depth

2. **Code Execution**
   - Execution count
   - Execution success rate
   - Execution time
   - Code modifications

3. **Feature Usage**
   - Button clicks
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Fullscreen mode
   - Copy code

4. **Learning**
   - Challenge attempts
   - Challenge completion
   - Example progression
   - Time to success
