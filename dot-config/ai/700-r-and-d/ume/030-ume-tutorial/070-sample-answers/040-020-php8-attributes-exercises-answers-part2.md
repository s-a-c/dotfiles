## Set 2: Attribute-Based Model Configuration

### Question Answers

1. **What is the purpose of attribute-based model configuration in the UME tutorial?**
   - **Answer: B) To provide a declarative way to configure model features**
   - Explanation: Attribute-based model configuration allows developers to declare model features directly on the model class, making the code more self-documenting and reducing the need for lengthy configuration methods.

2. **Which of the following is a valid attribute for configuring a model with ULID support?**
   - **Answer: A) `#[HasUlid]`**
   - Explanation: In the UME tutorial, the `#[HasUlid]` attribute is used to configure a model to use ULIDs as identifiers.

3. **How does the HasAdditionalFeatures trait process attributes?**
   - **Answer: B) It uses the Reflection API to read attributes at runtime**
   - Explanation: The HasAdditionalFeatures trait uses PHP's Reflection API to read attributes from the model class at runtime and configure the model's features accordingly.

4. **What happens if you apply both the `#[HasUlid]` attribute and manually configure ULID in the model's boot method?**
   - **Answer: B) The manual configuration takes precedence**
   - Explanation: In the UME tutorial, manual configuration in the model's boot method takes precedence over attribute-based configuration, allowing for more fine-grained control when needed.

5. **Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using attribute-based configuration for models?**
   - **Answer: C) Faster database queries**
   - Explanation: Attribute-based configuration improves code readability, type safety, and IDE support, but it does not directly affect database query performance.

### Exercise: Implement attribute-based configuration for a model

Here's a sample implementation of a `Post` model using attribute-based configuration:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\Attributes\HasSlug;
use App\Models\Attributes\HasTags;
use App\Models\Attributes\HasUlid;
use App\Models\Attributes\HasUserTracking;
use App\Models\Attributes\LogsActivity;
use App\Models\Traits\HasAdditionalFeatures;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

#[HasUlid(column: 'id')]
#[HasSlug(source: 'title', column: 'slug', updateOnChange: true)]
#[HasTags(types: ['category', 'tag'])]
#[HasUserTracking]
#[LogsActivity(logAttributes: ['title', 'content', 'published'], logOnlyDirty: true, submitEmptyLogs: false)]
class Post extends Model
{
    use HasAdditionalFeatures;

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'content',
        'published',
    ];

    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'published' => 'boolean',
    ];
}
```

Explanation of each attribute:

1. **`#[HasUlid(column: 'id')]`**:
   - Configures the model to use ULIDs as identifiers
   - Specifies that the ULID should be stored in the 'id' column
   - The HasAdditionalFeatures trait will automatically generate a ULID when creating a new model

2. **`#[HasSlug(source: 'title', column: 'slug', updateOnChange: true)]`**:
   - Configures the model to generate slugs from the 'title' field
   - Specifies that the slug should be stored in the 'slug' column
   - Sets updateOnChange to true, meaning the slug will be updated when the title changes
   - The HasAdditionalFeatures trait will automatically generate and update slugs

3. **`#[HasTags(types: ['category', 'tag'])]`**:
   - Configures the model to support tagging with 'category' and 'tag' types
   - The HasAdditionalFeatures trait will set up the necessary relationships and methods for tagging

4. **`#[HasUserTracking]`**:
   - Configures the model to track which users created, updated, and deleted the model
   - The HasAdditionalFeatures trait will automatically set 'created_by', 'updated_by', and 'deleted_by' fields

5. **`#[LogsActivity(logAttributes: ['title', 'content', 'published'], logOnlyDirty: true, submitEmptyLogs: false)]`**:
   - Configures the model to log activity for the 'title', 'content', and 'published' fields
   - Sets logOnlyDirty to true, meaning only changed attributes will be logged
   - Sets submitEmptyLogs to false, meaning empty logs will not be submitted
   - The HasAdditionalFeatures trait will set up activity logging for the model

The HasAdditionalFeatures trait processes these attributes at runtime using the Reflection API:

```php
protected static function configureFromAttributes(): void
{
    $reflection = new ReflectionClass(static::class);
    
    // Process HasUlid attribute
    $ulidAttributes = $reflection->getAttributes(HasUlidAttribute::class);
    foreach ($ulidAttributes as $attribute) {
        $instance = $attribute->newInstance();
        static::configureFeatures(function ($features) use ($instance) {
            $features->enable('ulid');
            if ($instance->column) {
                $features->configure('ulid', ['column' => $instance->column]);
            }
        });
    }
    
    // Process other attributes...
}
```

This approach offers several benefits:
- The model's features are clearly visible at the class level
- Configuration is type-safe and validated at compile time
- IDEs provide better support for attributes than for PHPDoc annotations
- The code is more self-documenting
- Feature implementation details are encapsulated in the trait
