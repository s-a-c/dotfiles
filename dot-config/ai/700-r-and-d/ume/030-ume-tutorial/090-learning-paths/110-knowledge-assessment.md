## Practical Exercises

Each learning path includes practical exercises to apply the concepts you've learned. These exercises are designed to be progressively challenging and to integrate multiple concepts.

### Exercise Types

1. **Guided Exercises**: Step-by-step instructions with hints
2. **Challenge Exercises**: Less guidance, more problem-solving
3. **Integration Exercises**: Combining multiple concepts
4. **Debugging Exercises**: Finding and fixing issues in existing code
5. **Extension Exercises**: Adding new features to existing code

### Sample Exercise: Implementing STI

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Objective**: Create a Single Table Inheritance structure for different user types.

**Requirements**:
1. Create a base User model
2. Create Admin, Customer, and Vendor child models
3. Implement type-specific methods for each child model
4. Create a migration to add the type column
5. Write tests to verify the implementation

**Steps**:
1. Create the migration:
   ```php
   Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
       $table->string('type')->default('App\\Models\\User')->after('id');
   });
   ```

2. Update the User model:
   ```php
   protected $fillable = [
       'name', 'email', 'password', 'type',
   ];

   protected $casts = [
       'type' => AsClassName::class,
   ];

   public function newInstance($attributes = [], $exists = false)
   {
       $model = isset($attributes['type']) 
           ? new $attributes['type'] 
           : new static;
           
       $model->exists = $exists;
       $model->setTable($this->getTable());
       $model->fill((array) $attributes);
       
       return $model;
   }
   ```

3. Create child models (example for Admin):
   ```php
   class Admin extends User
   {
       protected $attributes = [
           'type' => Admin::class,
       ];
       
       public function canAccessAdminPanel(): bool
       {
           return true;
       }
   }
   ```

4. Write a test:
   ```php
   public function test_it_creates_correct_user_type()
   {
       $admin = Admin::create([
           'name' => 'Admin User',
           'email' => 'admin@example.com',
           'password' => Hash::make('password'),
       ]);
       
       $this->assertInstanceOf(Admin::class, $admin);
       $this->assertEquals(Admin::class, $admin->type);
       
       $retrievedAdmin = User::find($admin->id);
       $this->assertInstanceOf(Admin::class, $retrievedAdmin);
   }
   ```

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Migration correctly adds the type column
- User model properly implements STI pattern
- Child models have type-specific methods
- Tests verify the correct behavior
- Code follows Laravel best practices

2. Configure Spatie Laravel Permission for team support
3. Implement methods to check team permissions
4. Create a UI for managing team permissions
5. Write tests to verify the implementation

**Steps**:
1. Create the Team model:
   ```php
   class Team extends Model
   {
       use HasUlid, HasUserTracking;

       protected $fillable = [
           'name', 'description', 'owner_id',
       ];

       public function owner()
       {
           return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'owner_id');
       }

       public function users()
       {
           return $this->belongsToMany(User::class, 'team_user')
               ->withPivot('role')
               ->withTimestamps();
       }
   }
   ```

2. Update User model:
   ```php
   public function teams()
   {
       return $this->belongsToMany(Team::class, 'team_user')
           ->withPivot('role')
           ->withTimestamps();
   }

   public function hasTeamPermission($team, $permission)
   {
       if ($this->isTeamOwner($team)) {
           return true;
       }

       return $this->permissions()
           ->where('team_id', $team->id)
           ->where('name', $permission)
           ->exists();
   }
   ```

3. Create a permission check middleware:
   ```php
   class TeamPermission
   {
       public function handle($request, Closure $next, $permission)
       {
           $team = $request->route('team');
           
           if (!$request->user()->hasTeamPermission($team, $permission)) {
               abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
           }
           
           return $next($request);
       }
   }
   ```

4. Write a test:
   ```php
   public function test_user_with_permission_can_access_team_resource()
   {
       $user = User::factory()->create();
       $team = Team::factory()->create();
       $permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'edit-team']);
       
       $team->users()->attach($user, ['role' => 'member']);
       $user->givePermissionTo($permission, $team);
       
       $response = $this->actingAs($user)
           ->get(route('teams.edit', $team));
       
       $response->assertStatus(200);
   }
   ```

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Team and User models correctly implement relationships
- Permission checks work correctly for team-specific permissions
- Middleware properly protects team resources
- Tests verify the correct behavior
- Code follows Laravel best practices

## Concept Maps

Concept maps help you visualize relationships between different concepts. Creating these maps helps reinforce your understanding and identify connections you might have missed.

### Sample Concept Map Exercise: User Model Relationships

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Objective**: Create a concept map showing the relationships between User, Team, Permission, and Role models.

**Instructions**:
1. Draw boxes for each model: User, Team, Permission, Role
2. Draw lines between related models
3. Label each line with the type of relationship (e.g., "belongs to", "has many")
4. Add key methods that facilitate these relationships
5. Highlight how permissions flow through these relationships

**Example Solution**:
```
User ---- belongs to many ----> Team
 |                               |
 | has many                      | has many
 v                               v
Role <---- belongs to many ---- Permission
 |                               ^
 | has many                      |
 v                               |
Permission ----------------------+
```
