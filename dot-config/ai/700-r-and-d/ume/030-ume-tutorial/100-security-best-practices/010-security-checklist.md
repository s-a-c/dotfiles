# Security Checklist for UME Implementation

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This comprehensive security checklist provides a phase-by-phase guide to ensuring your UME implementation follows security best practices. Use this checklist during development and before deployment to verify that your application is secure.

## Phase 0: Foundation

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Ensure Laravel Sanctum or Passport is properly configured for API authentication
- [ ] Verify that authentication guards are properly configured
- [ ] Confirm that password validation rules enforce strong passwords
- [ ] Ensure sensitive configuration values are stored in environment variables

### Data Protection
- [ ] Verify that the `.env` file is excluded from version control
- [ ] Ensure database credentials are properly secured
- [ ] Confirm that HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] Verify that sensitive data is encrypted at rest

### Development Environment
- [ ] Ensure development dependencies are not installed in production
- [ ] Verify that debug mode is disabled in production
- [ ] Confirm that error reporting is configured appropriately for each environment
- [ ] Install and configure `roave/security-advisories` to prevent using packages with known vulnerabilities

## Phase 1: Core Models & STI

### Model Security
- [ ] Ensure that mass assignment protection is in place for all models
- [ ] Verify that sensitive attributes are hidden from JSON/array serialization
- [ ] Confirm that type column for STI is properly validated
- [ ] Ensure that model relationships enforce proper access controls

### Database Security
- [ ] Verify that migrations use appropriate column types and constraints
- [ ] Ensure that indexes are created for columns used in WHERE clauses
- [ ] Confirm that foreign key constraints are properly defined
- [ ] Verify that database queries are protected against SQL injection

## Phase 2: Auth & Profiles

### Authentication Security
- [ ] Ensure that password hashing is properly configured
- [ ] Verify that password reset functionality is secure
- [ ] Confirm that remember-me functionality is properly implemented
- [ ] Implement and test two-factor authentication
- [ ] Ensure that account lockout is implemented for failed login attempts
- [ ] Verify that email verification is properly implemented

### Profile Security
- [ ] Ensure that profile updates require authentication
- [ ] Verify that file uploads for avatars are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] Confirm that profile information is properly validated
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for viewing and editing profiles

### State Machine Security
- [ ] Ensure that state transitions are properly validated
- [ ] Verify that state machine prevents unauthorized state changes
- [ ] Confirm that state transitions are logged for audit purposes

## Phase 3: Teams & Permissions

### Team Security
- [ ] Ensure that team creation and management is properly secured
- [ ] Verify that team membership changes require appropriate permissions
- [ ] Confirm that team data is properly isolated
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for team resources

### Permission Security
- [ ] Ensure that permission checks are consistently applied
- [ ] Verify that permission assignments require appropriate authorization
- [ ] Confirm that permission caching is implemented securely
- [ ] Implement proper validation for custom permissions

## Phase 4: Real-time Features

### WebSocket Security
- [ ] Ensure that WebSocket connections are authenticated
- [ ] Verify that channel authorization is properly implemented
- [ ] Confirm that sensitive data is not exposed through broadcasts
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for WebSocket connections

### Event Broadcasting
- [ ] Ensure that broadcast events contain only necessary data
- [ ] Verify that private channels are used for sensitive information
- [ ] Confirm that presence channels properly authenticate users
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for broadcast failures

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### API Security
- [ ] Ensure that API endpoints are properly authenticated
- [ ] Verify that API rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Confirm that API responses do not expose sensitive information
- [ ] Implement proper validation for API requests
- [ ] Ensure that API tokens have appropriate scopes and expirations

### Search Security
- [ ] Ensure that search queries are properly sanitized
- [ ] Verify that search results respect access controls
- [ ] Confirm that search indexing does not expose sensitive data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for search functionality

### Impersonation Security
- [ ] Ensure that impersonation requires appropriate permissions
- [ ] Verify that impersonation actions are logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Confirm that impersonation sessions are clearly indicated
- [ ] Implement proper controls for ending impersonation

## Phase 6: Polishing & Deployment

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Ensure that production environment is properly configured
- [ ] Verify that all debug features are disabled
- [ ] Confirm that error handling does not expose sensitive information
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Ensure that all dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Verify that security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Confirm that HTTPS is enforced with proper certificate configuration
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Maintenance Security
- [ ] Ensure that a security update process is in place
- [ ] Verify that security patches are applied promptly
- [ ] Confirm that security monitoring is implemented
- [ ] Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy
- [ ] Ensure that backup and recovery procedures are secure

## General Security Considerations

### Code Security
- [ ] Ensure that input validation is consistently applied
- [ ] Verify that output encoding is used to prevent XSS
- [ ] Confirm that CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
- [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Ensure that security-sensitive operations are logged
- [ ] Verify that dependencies are regularly updated
- [ ] Confirm that code follows security best practices

### Data Security
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Verify that data access is properly controlled
- [ ] Confirm that data retention policies are implemented
- [ ] Implement proper data backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Ensure that data deletion is secure

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Ensure that servers are properly hardened
- [ ] Verify that network security is properly configured
- [ ] Confirm that monitoring and alerting are in place
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for infrastructure
- [ ] Ensure that disaster recovery procedures are tested

## Using This Checklist

This checklist should be reviewed at the end of each implementation phase. For each item:

1. Verify that the security measure is implemented
2. Test the implementation to ensure it works as expected
3. Document any exceptions or mitigations
4. Update the checklist with the date of verification

Remember that security is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regularly review and update your security measures as your application evolves and new threats emerge.
