# WCAG Compliance Guide

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This guide provides an overview of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and how to ensure your UME implementation complies with these standards.

## What is WCAG?

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of recommendations for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. These guidelines are developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) through their Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

WCAG is organized around four main principles, often referred to as POUR:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## WCAG Conformance Levels

WCAG defines three levels of conformance:

- **Level A**: The minimum level of conformance. This level addresses the most basic web accessibility features.
- **Level AA**: The mid-range level of conformance. This level addresses the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
- **Level AAA**: The highest level of conformance. This level provides enhanced accessibility for users with specific needs.

Most organizations aim for Level AA compliance, which is often required by accessibility regulations and laws.

## Implementation Examples

### Accessible Login Form

```html
<form method="POST" action="/login">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email">Email Address</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required 
               aria-describedby="email-help">
        <small id="email-help" class="form-text">Enter the email address associated with your account</small>
    </div>
    
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required
               aria-describedby="password-help">
        <small id="password-help" class="form-text">Enter your password</small>
    </div>
    
    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="checkbox" id="remember" name="remember">
        <label for="remember">Remember me</label>
    </div>
    
    <button type="submit" aria-label="Log in to your account">Login</button>
    
    <div>
        <a href="/password/reset" aria-label="Reset your password">Forgot your password?</a>
    </div>
</form>
```

### Accessible Error Messages

```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Email Address</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" 
           aria-describedby="email-error" 
           aria-invalid="true">
    <div id="email-error" class="error-message" role="alert">
        Please enter a valid email address
    </div>
</div>
```

## Testing for WCAG Compliance

To ensure your UME implementation complies with WCAG standards, you should:

1. **Conduct automated testing** using tools like:
   - [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
   - [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
   - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

2. **Perform manual testing** using:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Browser extensions for accessibility testing

3. **Conduct user testing** with people who have disabilities

For more detailed testing procedures, refer to the [Accessibility Testing](./080-testing-procedures.md) section.
