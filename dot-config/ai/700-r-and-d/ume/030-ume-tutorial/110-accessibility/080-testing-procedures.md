# Accessibility Testing Procedures

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This guide provides comprehensive procedures for testing the accessibility of your UME implementation, including both manual and automated testing methods.

## Why Accessibility Testing Matters

Accessibility testing is essential to ensure that your UME implementation is usable by all people, including those with disabilities. Testing helps identify and fix accessibility issues before they affect users.

Regular accessibility testing should be part of your development process, just like functional testing and quality assurance.

## Testing Approaches

### 1. Automated Testing

Automated testing tools can quickly identify many common accessibility issues. However, they can only catch about 30-40% of all accessibility issues, so automated testing should be combined with manual testing.

#### Recommended Automated Testing Tools

- **[axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/)**: Browser extension for Chrome and Firefox
- **[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)**: Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)**: Integrated in Chrome DevTools
- **[Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/)**: Command-line tool for automated accessibility testing

#### Integrating Automated Testing in CI/CD

You can integrate accessibility testing into your continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to catch issues early.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow for accessibility testing
name: Accessibility Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  accessibility:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
      - name: Start server
        run: npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
      - name: Run accessibility tests
        run: |
          npm install -g pa11y-ci
          pa11y-ci --sitemap http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
```

### 2. Manual Testing

Manual testing involves human testers checking for accessibility issues that automated tools might miss. This includes testing with assistive technologies and keyboard navigation.

#### Keyboard Navigation Testing

Test all functionality using only the keyboard (no mouse):

1. **Tab through the entire page** to ensure all interactive elements are focusable and receive focus in a logical order.
2. **Check focus visibility** to ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus indicator.
3. **Test all functionality** using only the keyboard, including:
   - Form submission
   - Button activation
   - Link navigation
   - Modal dialogs
   - Dropdown menus
   - Tabs and accordions
4. **Verify that there are no keyboard traps** where focus cannot be moved away from an element using only the keyboard.

#### Screen Reader Testing

Test with at least one screen reader to ensure content is properly announced:

1. **Navigate through the entire page** using the screen reader's navigation commands.
2. **Check that all content is announced** correctly, including text, images, links, buttons, and form controls.
3. **Verify that dynamic content changes** are properly announced.
4. **Test form validation** to ensure error messages are announced.

Recommended screen readers for testing:

- **[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/)** (Windows, free)
- **[VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/mac/vision/)** (macOS, built-in)
- **[JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/)** (Windows, commercial)
- **[TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677)** (Android, built-in)

#### Visual Testing

Test for visual accessibility issues:

1. **Check color contrast** using tools like the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
2. **Test with high contrast mode** enabled in the operating system.
3. **Test with text size increased** to 200%.
4. **Test with zoom** set to 200%.
5. **Test with different color blindness simulators** to ensure information is not conveyed by color alone.

### 3. User Testing

User testing with people with disabilities provides the most valuable feedback. Consider recruiting users with different disabilities to test your UME implementation.

#### Types of Users to Include

- Users who are blind or have low vision
- Users with motor disabilities who use keyboard-only navigation
- Users with cognitive disabilities
- Users who are deaf or hard of hearing
- Users who use screen magnification
- Users with color blindness

#### User Testing Process

1. **Define clear tasks** for users to complete.
2. **Observe users** as they interact with your application.
3. **Ask for feedback** on their experience.
4. **Document issues** and prioritize fixes.

## Implementing Automated Testing in Laravel

### Using Laravel Dusk for Accessibility Testing

[Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/dusk) can be extended to include accessibility testing using the axe-core library.

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Browser;

use Laravel\Dusk\Browser;
use Tests\DuskTestCase;

class AccessibilityTest extends DuskTestCase
{
    /**
     * Test the login page for accessibility issues.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testLoginPageAccessibility()
    {
        $this->browse(function (Browser $browser) {
            $browser->visit('/login')
                    ->assertAccessible();
        });
    }
}
```

To add the `assertAccessible` method to Laravel Dusk, you can extend the Browser class:

```php
<?php

namespace Laravel\Dusk;

use Closure;

class Browser
{
    /**
     * Assert that the page passes accessibility tests.
     *
     * @param  array  $options
     * @return $this
     */
    public function assertAccessible(array $options = [])
    {
        $this->script("
            return new Promise((resolve) => {
                const script = document.createElement('script');
                script.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axe-core/4.4.1/axe.min.js';
                script.onload = function() {
                    axe.run(document, " . json_encode($options) . ").then(results => {
                        resolve(results);
                    });
                };
                document.head.appendChild(script);
            });
        ", function ($results) {
            $violations = $results['violations'] ?? [];
            
            if (count($violations) > 0) {
                $this->fail('Accessibility violations found: ' . json_encode($violations, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));
            }
            
            return $this;
        });
        
        return $this;
    }
}
```

### Using PHPUnit for Accessibility Testing

You can also use PHPUnit to test accessibility by making HTTP requests and then analyzing the HTML response:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use old\TestCase;

class AccessibilityTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * Test the login page for accessibility issues.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testLoginPageAccessibility()
    {
        $response = $this->get('/login');
        
        $response->assertStatus(200);
        
        // Check for basic accessibility requirements
        $content = $response->getContent();
        
        // Check for lang attribute on html tag
        $this->assertStringContainsString('<html lang=', $content);
        
        // Check for page title
        $this->assertStringContainsString('<title>', $content);
        
        // Check for skip link
        $this->assertStringContainsString('Skip to main content', $content);
        
        // Check for heading structure
        $this->assertStringContainsString('<h1', $content);
        
        // Check for form labels
        $this->assertStringContainsString('<label for=', $content);
    }
}
```

## Documenting Accessibility Testing Results

Document your accessibility testing results to track progress and identify areas for improvement.

### Sample Accessibility Test Report

```markdown

- **Moderate Issues**: 8
- **Minor Issues**: 12

#### Critical Issues

1. **Missing form labels** on the registration form
   - Impact: Screen reader users cannot identify form fields
   - Recommendation: Add proper labels to all form fields

2. **Insufficient color contrast** in the navigation menu
   - Impact: Users with low vision may have difficulty reading the text
   - Recommendation: Increase the contrast ratio to at least 4.5:1

3. **Keyboard trap** in the modal dialog
   - Impact: Keyboard users cannot exit the modal
   - Recommendation: Implement proper focus management for the modal

## Manual Testing Results

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Issue**: Focus order is not logical in the team management section
  - Impact: Keyboard users may have difficulty navigating the interface
  - Recommendation: Adjust the tab order to follow a logical sequence

### Screen Reader Testing (NVDA)

- **Issue**: Dynamic content changes are not announced
  - Impact: Screen reader users are not aware of content updates
  - Recommendation: Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content

## Recommendations

1. Fix critical issues immediately
2. Address serious issues in the next sprint
3. Plan for moderate and minor issues in future releases
4. Implement automated accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline
5. Conduct regular manual accessibility testing

## Next Steps

1. Create tickets for all identified issues
2. Prioritize fixes based on severity and impact
3. Retest after fixes are implemented
