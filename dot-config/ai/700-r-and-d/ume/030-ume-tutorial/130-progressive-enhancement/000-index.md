# Progressive Enhancement

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This section covers best practices for implementing progressive enhancement in your UME application, ensuring that your application works for all users regardless of their browser capabilities, network conditions, or device limitations.

## Overview

Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core content and functionality first, then progressively adds more advanced layers of presentation and features on top of the basic content as the end user's browser/internet connection/device allows.

## Why Progressive Enhancement Matters

In the context of UME applications, progressive enhancement:

1. **Improves Accessibility**: Ensures core functionality works for all users, including those with disabilities or using assistive technologies
2. **Enhances Reliability**: Creates applications that continue to function even when certain technologies fail
3. **Expands Reach**: Makes your application usable on a wider range of devices and browsers
4. **Future-Proofs Your Code**: Builds a solid foundation that can adapt to future technologies
5. **Improves Performance**: Focuses on delivering essential content first, improving perceived performance

## Key Concepts

Throughout this section, we'll focus on these key concepts:

1. **Feature Detection**: Detecting browser capabilities to provide appropriate experiences
2. **Fallback Strategies**: Providing alternatives when modern features aren't available
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensuring functionality degrades gracefully when features aren't supported
4. **Core vs. Enhancement**: Distinguishing between essential functionality and enhancements
5. **Accessibility**: Ensuring your application is usable by everyone
