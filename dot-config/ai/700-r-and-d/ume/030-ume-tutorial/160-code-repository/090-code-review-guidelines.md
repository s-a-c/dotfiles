## Purpose of Code Reviews

Code reviews serve several important purposes:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Identify bugs, logic errors, and edge cases
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread knowledge about the codebase
3. **Consistency**: Ensure code follows project standards
4. **Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
5. **Performance**: Identify performance issues
6. **Mentorship**: Help team members learn and improve
7. **Collective Ownership**: Foster shared responsibility for the codebase

## Code Review Process

The UME project follows a structured code review process:

### 1. Preparation

Before submitting code for review:

- Ensure all tests pass
- Review your own code
- Update documentation
- Ensure the code meets project standards

### 2. Pull Request Creation

Create a pull request following these steps:

1. Use an appropriate [pull request template](080-pull-request-templates.md)
2. Provide a clear description of the changes
3. Link related issues
4. Assign appropriate reviewers
5. Add relevant labels

### 3. Initial Review

The initial review phase:

1. Automated checks run (CI/CD, linting, tests)
2. Assigned reviewers are notified
3. Reviewers conduct an initial review

### 4. Feedback and Iteration

The feedback and iteration phase:

1. Reviewers provide feedback using GitHub's review tools
2. Author addresses feedback
3. Author requests re-review when changes are made
4. Process repeats until all issues are resolved

### 5. Approval and Merge

The approval and merge phase:

1. Reviewers approve the pull request
2. Final checks are performed
3. The pull request is merged
4. The branch is deleted

## Reviewer Guidelines

### General Approach

1. **Be Timely**: Review code promptly (within 1-2 business days)
2. **Be Thorough**: Take the time to understand the code
3. **Be Respectful**: Use constructive language
4. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable feedback
5. **Be Balanced**: Note both positive aspects and areas for improvement

### Review Focus Areas

Focus on these key areas during review:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Architecture**: Is the design appropriate?
3. **Complexity**: Is the code unnecessarily complex?
4. **Performance**: Are there performance concerns?
5. **Security**: Are there security vulnerabilities?
6. **Maintainability**: Will the code be easy to maintain?
7. **Testability**: Is the code well-tested?
8. **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?
9. **Standards**: Does the code follow project standards?

### Providing Feedback

When providing feedback:

1. **Ask Questions**: Use questions to understand intent
2. **Explain Why**: Explain the reasoning behind your feedback
3. **Suggest Alternatives**: Offer alternative approaches
4. **Prioritize Issues**: Distinguish between critical and minor issues
5. **Use Code Examples**: Provide examples when helpful

### Feedback Phrasing

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "This is wrong" | "This might cause an issue when..." |
| "Why did you do this?" | "Can you explain the reasoning behind this approach?" |
| "You should use X" | "Have you considered using X? It might help with..." |
| "This code is messy" | "This section could be more maintainable by..." |
| "This doesn't follow standards" | "Our project standards suggest using X pattern here" |

## Handling Disagreements

When disagreements arise during code reviews:

1. **Focus on Facts**: Base discussions on technical facts
2. **Consider Trade-offs**: Acknowledge that different approaches have trade-offs
3. **Provide Evidence**: Support arguments with evidence or examples
4. **Seek Third Opinions**: Involve other team members when needed
5. **Document Decisions**: Record the reasoning behind decisions
6. **Respect Project Standards**: Defer to established project standards
7. **Compromise When Appropriate**: Be willing to compromise
8. **Escalate When Necessary**: Have a clear escalation path for unresolved issues

### Escalation Process

If a disagreement cannot be resolved:

1. Involve a senior developer or tech lead
2. Schedule a synchronous discussion
3. Document the decision and reasoning
4. Update project standards if needed

## Tools and Automation

The UME project uses several tools to enhance the code review process:

### GitHub Features

- **Pull Request Reviews**: For providing feedback
- **Review Requests**: For assigning reviewers
- **Review Comments**: For inline feedback
- **Suggested Changes**: For proposing specific edits
- **Draft Pull Requests**: For work in progress

### Automated Checks

- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines
- **PHPStan**: For static analysis
- **PHP_CodeSniffer**: For coding standards
- **PHPUnit**: For unit and feature tests
- **ESLint**: For JavaScript linting
- **StyleLint**: For CSS linting
- **Dusk Tests**: For browser testing

### Review Tools

- **GitHub Code Owners**: For automatic reviewer assignment
- **Review Checklists**: For consistent reviews
- **Pull Request Templates**: For structured information
- **Code Climate**: For code quality metrics
- **SonarQube**: For code quality and security analysis

## Code Review Metrics

The UME project tracks these code review metrics:

1. **Time to First Review**: How quickly reviews start
2. **Time to Resolution**: How long until PRs are merged
3. **Review Coverage**: Percentage of code changes reviewed
4. **Issues Found**: Number and types of issues identified
5. **Review Size**: Lines of code per review
6. **Review Frequency**: Number of reviews per time period
7. **Reviewer Participation**: Distribution of review work
8. **Feedback Incorporation**: Percentage of feedback addressed

These metrics help improve the review process over time.

## Special Considerations

### Large Changes

For exceptionally large changes:

1. Break into smaller, logical pull requests
2. Consider incremental reviews
3. Provide architectural overview
4. Schedule dedicated review sessions
5. Use feature branches for long-running changes

### Critical Path Changes

For changes to critical system components:

1. Require multiple reviewers
2. Conduct more thorough testing
3. Consider phased deployment
4. Document risks and mitigation strategies
5. Schedule dedicated review sessions

### Junior Developer Contributions

When reviewing code from junior developers:

1. Be more detailed in explanations
2. Focus on teaching, not just identifying issues
3. Highlight positive aspects
4. Provide resources for learning
5. Be patient and supportive

## Code Review Examples

### Example 1: Constructive Feedback

```
I notice this query might cause an N+1 problem when looping through the results.
Consider eager loading the relationship like this:

```php
$users = User::with('teams')->get();
```

This would reduce the number of database queries significantly.
```

### Example 2: Asking Questions

```
I'm curious about the choice to use a trait here instead of inheritance.
Could you explain the reasoning? I'm wondering if this approach might
make it harder to track the behavior flow.
```

### Example 3: Suggesting Alternatives

```
This validation logic works, but it might be cleaner to use Laravel's
form request validation. This would move the validation rules out of
the controller and make them more reusable. What do you think?
```

## Conclusion

Effective code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and fostering a collaborative development environment. By following these guidelines, the UME project can ensure consistent, constructive, and efficient code reviews.
