# "See Also" Sections Implementation

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This document provides comprehensive guidance for implementing standardized "See Also" sections across all UME tutorial documentation. It includes templates, examples, and implementation strategies to ensure consistent and valuable cross-references.

## Purpose of "See Also" Sections

"See Also" sections serve several important purposes:

1. **Navigation Enhancement**: Provide clear pathways to related content
2. **Concept Connections**: Highlight relationships between different topics
3. **Learning Support**: Guide users through logical learning sequences
4. **Discoverability**: Improve content discoverability beyond search
5. **Completeness**: Ensure users can find all relevant information

## Standard Template

Every UME documentation page should include a "See Also" section at the end of the document, following this template:

```markdown
## See Also

- [Document Title](relative/path/to/document.md) - Brief description of relevance
- [Another Document](relative/path/to/another.md) - Brief description of relevance
- [Third Document](relative/path/to/third.md) - Brief description of relevance
```

### Template Guidelines

1. **Heading Level**: Always use level 2 heading (`##`)
2. **Placement**: Always at the end of the document, after the conclusion
3. **Format**: Bulleted list with links and descriptions
4. **Number of Items**: Include 3-7 most relevant related documents
5. **Order**: Arrange by relevance, with most relevant first
6. **Descriptions**: 1-2 lines explaining the relationship to the current document

## Types of "See Also" References

Different types of references should be included based on the document's content:

### 1. Prerequisite References

Links to content that should be understood before the current topic.

**Example**:
```markdown
- [User Model Basics](../020-models/010-user-model.md) - Understand the foundational User model before implementing Single Table Inheritance
```

### 2. Next Step References

Links to content that naturally follows the current topic.

**Example**:
```markdown
- [User Types](../020-models/040-user-types.md) - Implement specific user types after setting up Single Table Inheritance
```

### 3. Alternative Approach References

Links to alternative implementations or approaches.

**Example**:
```markdown
- [Class Table Inheritance](../020-models/060-class-table-inheritance.md) - An alternative inheritance approach to consider for complex hierarchies
```

### 4. Related Concept References

Links to related concepts that complement the current topic.

**Example**:
```markdown
- [Polymorphic Relationships](../020-models/070-polymorphic-relationships.md) - Another way to handle relationships between different model types
```

### 5. Implementation Example References

Links to practical examples of the concept.

**Example**:
```markdown
- [User Type Implementation](../020-models/080-user-type-implementation.md) - Step-by-step implementation of user types using Single Table Inheritance

## Implementation Strategy

To implement "See Also" sections across all UME documentation:

### 1. Prioritization

Implement "See Also" sections in this order:

1. Core concept documents
2. Tutorial documents
3. Reference documents
4. Quick reference documents
5. Appendix documents

### 2. Selection Process

For each document, select related documents based on:

1. **Concept Map**: Use the [Concept Relationship Map](030-concept-relationship-map.md) to identify related concepts
2. **User Journey**: Consider common user journeys through the documentation
3. **Implementation Dependencies**: Include prerequisites and next steps
4. **Complementary Topics**: Include topics that provide additional context
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Include alternative implementations

### 3. Description Writing

Write descriptions that:

1. Explain the relationship to the current document
2. Highlight key information the reader will find
3. Provide context for why it might be useful
4. Are concise (1-2 lines maximum)

### 4. Review Process

After implementation, review for:

1. **Reciprocity**: Ensure bidirectional links between related documents
2. **Relevance**: Verify that references are truly relevant
3. **Completeness**: Check that all important relationships are covered
4. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent formatting and style
5. **Accuracy**: Verify that links are correct and descriptions accurate

4. **Analytics**: Use documentation analytics to identify navigation patterns
5. **New Relationships**: Add new relationships as the concept map evolves

## Implementation Checklist

For each document:

- [ ] Identify 3-7 most relevant related documents
- [ ] Write concise descriptions explaining relationships
- [ ] Format according to the standard template
- [ ] Place at the end of the document
- [ ] Verify all links are correct
- [ ] Ensure bidirectional links where appropriate
- [ ] Review for relevance and completeness

## Conclusion

Implementing standardized "See Also" sections across all UME documentation will significantly enhance navigation, improve content discoverability, and provide clearer pathways through related concepts. By following these guidelines, the documentation will become more interconnected and valuable for users at all levels.
