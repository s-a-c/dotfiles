This document outlines the process for testing the UME tutorial documentation across different browsers to ensure a consistent and functional experience for all users.

## Overview

Browser compatibility testing ensures that interactive elements, layouts, and functionality work correctly across different browsers and devices. This is particularly important for documentation that includes interactive code examples, diagrams, and other dynamic content.

## Browser Support Matrix

The UME tutorial documentation should be tested on the following browsers and versions:

| Browser | Versions | Priority |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Chrome | Latest, Latest-1 | High |
| Firefox | Latest, Latest-1 | High |
| Safari | Latest, Latest-1 | High |
| Edge | Latest, Latest-1 | High |
| Opera | Latest | Medium |
| Samsung Internet | Latest | Medium |
| iOS Safari | Latest, Latest-1 | High |
| Android Chrome | Latest, Latest-1 | High |

## Testing Process

The browser compatibility testing process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Preparation

Before beginning the testing:

- Identify the key interactive elements to test
- Create a test plan with specific scenarios
- Set up testing environments for each browser
- Prepare a checklist of aspects to test
- Set up tools for capturing and documenting issues

### 2. Visual Layout Testing

For each browser in the support matrix:

1. **Check overall layout**: Ensure the layout is consistent and properly aligned
2. **Test responsive design**: Verify that the layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes
3. **Check typography**: Ensure fonts render correctly and are legible
4. **Verify colors and contrast**: Ensure colors display correctly and maintain sufficient contrast
5. **Check images and diagrams**: Ensure images and diagrams display correctly
6. **Verify dark/light mode**: Ensure dark and light modes work correctly
7. **Document issues**: Record any visual layout issues found during testing

### 3. Functional Testing

For each browser in the support matrix:

1. **Test navigation**: Ensure navigation elements work correctly
2. **Test interactive code examples**: Verify that code examples can be edited and executed
3. **Test diagrams**: Ensure interactive diagrams work correctly
4. **Test search functionality**: Verify that search works correctly
5. **Test forms**: Ensure forms can be filled out and submitted
6. **Test links**: Verify that internal and external links work correctly
7. **Document issues**: Record any functional issues found during testing

### 4. Performance Testing

For each browser in the support matrix:

1. **Check page load time**: Measure the time it takes for pages to load
2. **Test scrolling performance**: Ensure smooth scrolling throughout the documentation
3. **Check interactive element responsiveness**: Verify that interactive elements respond quickly
4. **Test animation performance**: Ensure animations run smoothly
5. **Document issues**: Record any performance issues found during testing

### 5. Issue Documentation and Prioritization

After completing the testing:

1. **Compile issues**: Gather all issues found during testing
2. **Categorize issues**: Categorize issues by type (layout, functionality, performance)
3. **Prioritize issues**: Prioritize issues based on severity, impact, and browser popularity
4. **Assign issues**: Assign issues to team members for resolution
5. **Track resolution**: Track the resolution of issues
