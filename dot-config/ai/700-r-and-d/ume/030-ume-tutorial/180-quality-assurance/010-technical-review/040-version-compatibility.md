This document outlines the process for checking the compatibility of the UME tutorial documentation with different Laravel versions, ensuring that users can successfully implement the described features regardless of their Laravel version.

## Overview

Laravel version compatibility is crucial for documentation that spans multiple Laravel releases. As Laravel evolves, APIs, features, and best practices change, which can affect the accuracy and relevance of documentation. This document provides a structured approach to verifying and maintaining version compatibility.

## Version Support Matrix

The UME tutorial documentation primarily targets Laravel 12, but should be compatible with the following Laravel versions:

| Laravel Version | Support Level | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| 12.x | Primary | Full support, all features tested |
| 11.x | Secondary | Most features supported, some adaptations required |
| 10.x | Limited | Core features supported, significant adaptations required |
| < 10.x | Not Supported | Not compatible with UME tutorial |

## Compatibility Checking Process

The Laravel version compatibility checking process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Preparation

Before beginning the compatibility check:

- Set up clean Laravel installations for each supported version
- Install all required packages and dependencies for each version
- Configure the development environment according to the prerequisites
- Prepare a checklist of features to test
- Gather reference materials for each Laravel version

### 2. Feature Compatibility Testing

For each major feature in the UME tutorial:

1. **Identify version-specific APIs**: Determine which Laravel APIs are used
2. **Check API changes**: Research API changes between Laravel versions
3. **Test implementation**: Implement the feature in each supported Laravel version
4. **Document compatibility**: Record compatibility status and any required adaptations
5. **Create version-specific notes**: Document version-specific considerations

### 3. Package Compatibility Testing

For each required package:

1. **Check version requirements**: Verify package version requirements for each Laravel version
2. **Test installation**: Install the package in each supported Laravel version
3. **Test functionality**: Verify that the package works as expected in each version
4. **Document compatibility**: Record compatibility status and any required adaptations
5. **Create version-specific notes**: Document version-specific considerations

### 4. Configuration Compatibility Testing

For configuration-related content:

1. **Identify configuration changes**: Determine configuration changes between Laravel versions
2. **Test configuration**: Apply configuration in each supported Laravel version
3. **Verify behavior**: Ensure configuration produces the expected behavior
4. **Document compatibility**: Record compatibility status and any required adaptations
5. **Create version-specific notes**: Document version-specific considerations

### 5. Issue Documentation and Prioritization

After completing the compatibility check:

1. **Compile issues**: Gather all compatibility issues found during testing
2. **Categorize issues**: Categorize issues by type (API change, package compatibility, etc.)
3. **Prioritize issues**: Prioritize issues based on severity and impact
4. **Assign issues**: Assign issues to team members for resolution
5. **Track resolution**: Track the resolution of issues
