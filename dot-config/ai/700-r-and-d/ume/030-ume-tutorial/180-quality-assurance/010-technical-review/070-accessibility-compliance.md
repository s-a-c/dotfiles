This document outlines the process for verifying accessibility compliance in the UME tutorial documentation. Ensuring accessibility is essential for providing equal access to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

## Overview

Accessibility compliance verification ensures that the UME documentation follows web accessibility standards, particularly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at Level AA. This process involves testing various aspects of the documentation to ensure it can be used by people with different abilities and using different assistive technologies.

## Accessibility Standards

The UME documentation aims to comply with:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: The internationally recognized standard for web accessibility
- **Section 508**: U.S. federal regulations requiring accessibility for information technology
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**: U.S. legislation prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities

## Verification Process

Follow these steps to thoroughly verify accessibility compliance:

### 1. Preparation

1. **Gather Testing Tools**:
   - Automated accessibility testing tools
   - Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Keyboard-only navigation setup
   - Color contrast analyzers
   - Browser developer tools with accessibility features

2. **Define Testing Scope**:
   - Identify key pages and components to test
   - Prioritize high-traffic documentation sections
   - Include interactive elements like code examples
   - Include search functionality and navigation elements

3. **Create Testing Personas**:
   - Screen reader users
   - Keyboard-only users
   - Users with low vision
   - Users with color blindness
   - Users with cognitive disabilities
   - Users with motor disabilities

### 2. Automated Testing

1. **Run Automated Accessibility Tools**:
   - Use tools like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse
   - Scan representative pages from each documentation section
   - Generate reports of accessibility issues

2. **Analyze Results**:
   - Categorize issues by severity
   - Identify patterns of recurring issues
   - Document false positives
   - Prioritize issues for remediation

3. **Validate Automated Results**:
   - Manually verify a sample of reported issues
   - Check for issues that automated tools might miss
   - Document discrepancies between automated and manual testing

### 3. Manual Testing

#### 3.1 Keyboard Accessibility

1. **Navigation Testing**:
   - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Test tab order for logical flow
   - Verify focus indicators are visible
   - Test keyboard shortcuts (if implemented)
   - Verify no keyboard traps exist

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Test code examples with keyboard navigation
   - Verify dropdown menus are keyboard operable
   - Test modal dialogs for keyboard accessibility
   - Verify custom UI components are keyboard accessible

#### 3.2 Screen Reader Testing

1. **Content Structure**:
   - Verify proper heading structure (H1-H6)
   - Test landmark regions (main, nav, etc.)
   - Verify lists are properly structured
   - Test table accessibility with row/column headers

2. **Text Alternatives**:
   - Verify images have appropriate alt text

   - Test color contrast of code syntax highlighting

2. **Text Resizing**:
   - Test content at 200% zoom
   - Verify no loss of content or functionality when zoomed
   - Test responsive behavior at different text sizes
   - Verify no horizontal scrolling at 400% zoom with reflow

3. **Visual Presentation**:
   - Verify line height is at least 1.5 times font size
   - Test paragraph spacing is at least 2 times font size
   - Verify text can be styled by user stylesheets
   - Test content width is not fixed in viewport units

#### 3.4 Cognitive Accessibility

1. **Readability**:
   - Verify clear and simple language is used
   - Test reading level of content
   - Verify technical terms are explained
   - Test content organization and structure

2. **Predictability**:
   - Verify consistent navigation across pages
   - Test predictable behavior of interactive elements
   - Verify changes of context are user-initiated
   - Test error prevention and correction

### 4. Documentation-Specific Testing

1. **Code Examples**:
   - Verify code examples are accessible to screen readers
   - Test syntax highlighting for sufficient contrast
   - Verify code can be copied with keyboard
   - Test interactive code examples for accessibility

2. **Technical Diagrams**:
   - Verify diagrams have text alternatives
   - Test complex diagrams for detailed descriptions
   - Verify SVG diagrams are accessible
   - Test Mermaid diagrams for accessibility

3. **Interactive Tutorials**:
   - Verify step-by-step instructions are accessible
   - Test progress indicators for screen reader accessibility
   - Verify time limits are adjustable or not present
   - Test error handling and feedback mechanisms

### 5. Documentation and Reporting

1. **Create Accessibility Compliance Report**:
   - Document testing methodology
   - List tools and assistive technologies used
   - Document compliance level achieved
   - List issues found and remediation status

2. **Prioritize Issues**:
   - Critical: Blocks access for users with disabilities
   - High: Significantly impairs access
   - Medium: Causes difficulties but workarounds exist
   - Low: Minor inconveniences

3. **Create Remediation Plan**:
   - Document steps to address each issue
   - Assign responsibilities
   - Set deadlines based on priority
   - Define retesting process
