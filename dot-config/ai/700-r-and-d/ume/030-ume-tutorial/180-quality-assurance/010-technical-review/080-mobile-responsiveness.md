This document outlines the process for testing mobile responsiveness in the UME tutorial documentation. Ensuring the documentation works well on mobile devices is essential for providing a good user experience to all users, regardless of their device.

## Overview

Mobile responsiveness testing ensures that the UME documentation is accessible, readable, and functional on a variety of mobile devices and screen sizes. This process involves testing the layout, navigation, interactive elements, and content presentation across different devices and orientations.

## Testing Process

Follow these steps to thoroughly test mobile responsiveness:

### 1. Preparation

1. **Define Device Testing Matrix**:
   - Identify key device categories (smartphones, tablets)
   - Select representative devices for each category
   - Include different screen sizes and resolutions
   - Consider different operating systems (iOS, Android)
   - Include older devices with smaller screens

2. **Set Up Testing Environment**:
   - Physical devices for primary testing
   - Device emulators/simulators for additional testing
   - Browser developer tools with device emulation
   - Remote testing services (BrowserStack, LambdaTest, etc.)
   - Screen recording software (optional)

3. **Define Testing Scenarios**:
   - Basic content viewing
   - Navigation through documentation
   - Interactive code examples
   - Search functionality
   - Form interactions
