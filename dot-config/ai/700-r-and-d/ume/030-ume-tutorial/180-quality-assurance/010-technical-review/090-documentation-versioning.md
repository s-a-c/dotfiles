This document outlines the process for testing documentation versioning in the UME tutorial documentation. Proper versioning ensures users can access documentation relevant to their specific Laravel and UME version.

## Overview

Documentation versioning testing ensures that the version control system for the UME documentation works correctly, allowing users to access the appropriate version of the documentation for their implementation. This process involves testing version selection, content accuracy across versions, and the overall user experience of navigating between versions.

## Testing Process

Follow these steps to thoroughly test documentation versioning:

### 1. Preparation

1. **Identify Version Structure**:
   - Document the versioning scheme (semantic versioning, Laravel version alignment, etc.)
   - List all available documentation versions
   - Map Laravel versions to documentation versions
   - Identify major feature changes between versions

2. **Set Up Testing Environment**:
   - Ensure access to all documentation versions
   - Prepare testing across different browsers
   - Set up version-specific test cases
   - Prepare version comparison checklist

3. **Define Testing Scenarios**:
   - Version selector functionality
   - Version-specific content accuracy
   - Cross-version navigation
   - Version-specific search
   - URL structure and persistence
   - Redirects from deprecated content

### 2. Version Selection Testing

1. **Version Selector UI**:
   - Verify version selector is prominently displayed
   - Test dropdown/selector functionality
   - Verify current version is clearly indicated
   - Test keyboard accessibility of version selector
   - Verify mobile responsiveness of version selector

2. **Version Navigation**:
   - Test navigation between versions
   - Verify URL structure reflects version changes
   - Test browser history behavior when changing versions
   - Verify page position is maintained when possible
   - Test deep linking to specific versions

3. **Default Version Behavior**:
   - Verify appropriate default version is shown to new visitors
   - Test version detection based on referrer (if implemented)
   - Verify version persistence across sessions
   - Test version preference storage
   - Verify version recommendation logic (if implemented)

### 3. Content Accuracy Testing

1. **Version-Specific Content**:
   - Verify content matches the specified version
   - Test version-specific code examples
   - Verify version-specific screenshots and diagrams
   - Test version-specific API references
   - Verify configuration examples match version

2. **Version Differences**:
   - Test content that changes significantly between versions
   - Verify deprecated features are properly marked
   - Test new feature documentation in newer versions
   - Verify breaking changes are highlighted
   - Test migration guides between versions

3. **Cross-Version References**:
   - Verify links to other documentation sections maintain version context
   - Test references to Laravel documentation with version alignment
   - Verify package version references are accurate
   - Test external links for version relevance
   - Verify version-specific GitHub repository links

### 4. Search and Navigation Testing

1. **Version-Specific Search**:
   - Verify search results are limited to current version
   - Test search across all versions (if implemented)
   - Verify search result version indicators
   - Test version filtering in search results
   - Verify search index is version-aware

2. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Test navigation menu for version-specific items
   - Verify section availability across versions
   - Test version-specific redirects
   - Verify breadcrumbs maintain version context
   - Test "not available in this version" handling

3. **URL Structure**:
   - Verify URLs include version information
   - Test direct access to versioned URLs
   - Verify URL structure consistency across versions
   - Test URL redirects for renamed/moved content
   - Verify canonical URLs for SEO

### 5. Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

1. **Version Upgrades**:
   - Test documentation during version transitions
   - Verify upgrade guides between versions
   - Test "what's new" sections for accuracy
   - Verify deprecated feature warnings
   - Test migration instructions between versions

2. **Legacy Support**:
   - Verify access to documentation for older versions
   - Test archived version indicators
   - Verify maintenance status indicators
   - Test end-of-life notifications for very old versions
   - Verify upgrade recommendations for outdated versions

3. **Pre-release Versions**:
   - Test beta/RC documentation (if available)
   - Verify pre-release indicators
   - Test stability warnings
   - Verify links to stable versions
   - Test feature preview documentation

### 6. Technical Implementation Testing

1. **Version Generation**:
   - Verify build process for versioned documentation
   - Test version tagging system
   - Verify content freezing for stable versions
   - Test version metadata generation
   - Verify version manifest files

2. **Hosting and Delivery**:
   - Test CDN configuration for versioned content
   - Verify caching behavior across versions
   - Test version-specific assets
   - Verify server routing for versioned content
   - Test load times across different versions

3. **Version Management**:
   - Verify version addition process
   - Test version deprecation process
   - Verify version archiving
   - Test version redirect configuration
   - Verify version synchronization across environments

### 7. Documentation and Reporting

1. **Document Testing Results**:
   - Create detailed report of findings
   - Document version-specific issues
   - Note cross-version inconsistencies
   - Prioritize issues by severity
   - Document recommendations for improvement

2. **Create Action Items**:
   - Identify required fixes
   - Prioritize improvements
   - Document process improvements
   - Create timeline for addressing issues
   - Assign responsibilities for fixes
