**Process**:
1. Create multiple versions of interactive examples
2. Assign participants to different versions
3. Measure performance and satisfaction with each version
4. Compare results to identify the most effective approach

### Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing allows users to freely explore interactive features without specific tasks.

**Process**:
1. Participant explores interactive examples without guidance
2. Facilitator observes discovery and usage patterns
3. Participant shares thoughts and impressions
4. Facilitator asks about expectations and surprises

### Technical Compatibility Testing

Technical testing verifies that interactive examples work across different environments.

**Process**:
1. Test interactive examples on various browsers and devices
2. Verify functionality with different user settings
3. Test with assistive technologies
4. Identify technical limitations or issues
