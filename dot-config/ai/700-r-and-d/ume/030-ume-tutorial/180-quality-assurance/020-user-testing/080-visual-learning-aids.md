## Feedback Collection Methods

The UME tutorial documentation uses several methods to collect feedback on visual learning aids:

### Guided Evaluation Sessions

Guided evaluation sessions involve one-on-one interviews with users to gather detailed feedback on specific visual aids.

**Process**:
1. Select visual aids for evaluation
2. Prepare evaluation questions
3. Recruit participants
4. Conduct one-on-one sessions
5. Record and analyze feedback

**Sample Questions**:
- What does this diagram tell you about [concept]?
- Which parts of this visual aid are most helpful?
- Which parts are confusing or unclear?
- How would you improve this visual aid?
- How does this visual aid compare to the text explanation?

### Comprehension Testing

Comprehension testing assesses how well users understand concepts with and without visual aids.

**Process**:
1. Create comprehension questions
2. Divide participants into groups
3. Present content with visual aids to one group and without to another
4. Measure comprehension through questions
5. Compare results between groups

**Sample Comprehension Questions**:
- Explain the relationship between [component A] and [component B]
- What happens when [event] occurs in the system?
- Describe the process of [procedure]
- What are the key components of [architecture]?
- How does [feature] work?

### Visual Aid Surveys

Surveys collect quantitative and qualitative feedback from a larger number of users.

**Process**:
1. Create survey questions about visual aids
2. Distribute survey to documentation users
3. Collect responses
4. Analyze quantitative and qualitative data
5. Identify patterns and insights

**Sample Survey Questions**:
- Rate the clarity of this diagram (1-5 scale)
- How helpful was this visual aid in understanding the concept? (1-5 scale)
- What did you like most about this visual aid?
- What would make this visual aid more effective?
- Which visual aids were most helpful in the documentation?

### A/B Testing

A/B testing compares different versions of visual aids to determine which is more effective.

**Process**:
1. Create alternative versions of visual aids
2. Randomly assign users to different versions
3. Measure comprehension, satisfaction, and task success
4. Compare results between versions
5. Identify the most effective approach

**Metrics to Compare**:
- Comprehension scores
- Time to understand
- User preference ratings
- Task success rates
- Confidence ratings

### Eye Tracking Studies

Eye tracking studies analyze how users visually process and interact with visual aids.

**Process**:
1. Set up eye tracking equipment
2. Recruit participants
3. Present visual aids to participants
4. Record eye movements and fixations
5. Analyze viewing patterns

**Metrics to Collect**:
- Fixation points (where users look)
- Fixation duration (how long they look)
- Scan paths (how eyes move through the visual)
- Areas of interest (which parts attract attention)
- Time to first fixation (how quickly elements are noticed)
