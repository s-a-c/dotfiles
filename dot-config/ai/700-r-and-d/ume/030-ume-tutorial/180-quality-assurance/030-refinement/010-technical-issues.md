## Issue Resolution Process

The technical issue resolution process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Issue Triage

Before beginning resolution:

- Review all technical issues identified during review
- Categorize issues by type and affected content
- Assess severity and impact of each issue
- Prioritize issues based on severity, impact, and dependencies
- Assign issues to appropriate team members

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

For each prioritized issue:

1. **Understand the issue**: Review the issue description and related content
2. **Reproduce the issue**: Verify that the issue exists and can be reproduced
3. **Identify the root cause**: Determine what caused the issue
4. **Document findings**: Record the root cause and any related factors
5. **Consider implications**: Identify other content that might be affected

### 3. Solution Development

Based on the root cause analysis:

1. **Develop potential solutions**: Brainstorm ways to address the issue
2. **Evaluate solutions**: Consider effectiveness, effort, and potential side effects
3. **Select the best solution**: Choose the most appropriate solution
4. **Create an implementation plan**: Define specific changes needed
5. **Document the solution**: Record the chosen solution and implementation plan

### 4. Implementation

Execute the implementation plan:

1. **Make necessary changes**: Update content, code examples, or references
2. **Follow documentation standards**: Ensure changes adhere to established standards
3. **Update related content**: Make corresponding changes to related content
4. **Document changes**: Record what was changed and why
5. **Commit changes**: Save and commit changes to the documentation repository

### 5. Verification

After implementation:

1. **Review changes**: Verify that changes address the original issue
2. **Test code examples**: Ensure updated code examples work correctly
3. **Check for side effects**: Verify that changes don't introduce new issues
4. **Validate with experts**: Have subject matter experts review critical fixes
5. **Update issue status**: Mark the issue as resolved if verification passes

### 6. Documentation

Document the resolution process:

1. **Update issue tracker**: Record resolution details in the issue tracking system
2. **Create resolution report**: Document the issue, root cause, and solution
3. **Communicate changes**: Inform relevant stakeholders about significant fixes
4. **Update change log**: Add entry to documentation change log if appropriate
5. **Share lessons learned**: Document any insights gained for future reference

## Prioritization Framework

Use this framework to prioritize technical issues:

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Incorrect information that could lead to system failure or security vulnerability
- **High**: Significant technical inaccuracy that would prevent feature implementation
- **Medium**: Technical issue that could cause confusion or minor implementation problems
- **Low**: Minor technical inaccuracy with minimal impact on implementation

### Impact Factors
- **Audience size**: How many users are affected
- **Feature importance**: How critical the affected feature is
- **Visibility**: How prominent the issue is in the documentation
- **Frequency**: How often users would encounter the issue
- **Workaround availability**: Whether users can work around the issue

### Priority Matrix

| Severity | High Impact | Medium Impact | Low Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Critical | P0 (Immediate) | P1 (Urgent) | P1 (Urgent) |
| High | P1 (Urgent) | P2 (High) | P2 (High) |
| Medium | P2 (High) | P3 (Medium) | P4 (Low) |
| Low | P3 (Medium) | P4 (Low) | P5 (Backlog) |

## Common Resolution Strategies

# Technical Issue Resolution: Incorrect Team Permission Check Example

## Issue Details
- **Category**: Code Example
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: P1 (Urgent)
- **Affected Content**: docs/100-user-model-enhancements/031-ume-tutorial/080-teams-and-permissions/040-team-permissions.md
- **Identified By**: John Smith (Technical Reviewer)
- **Identification Date**: May 10, 2024

## Issue Description
The code example for checking team permissions contains a logical error. It uses `hasTeamPermission()` with incorrect parameters, which would cause the permission check to always return false.

## Impact
Users following this example would implement incorrect permission checks, potentially causing security issues by either granting too much access or preventing legitimate access.

## Root Cause Analysis
The example was written based on an early API design that was later changed. The documentation was not updated to reflect the final API design.

## Solution
Update the code example to use the correct parameter order and method signature for the `hasTeamPermission()` method.

## Implementation Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - docs/100-user-model-enhancements/031-ume-tutorial/080-teams-and-permissions/040-team-permissions.md
- **Changes Made**:
  - Changed `$user->hasTeamPermission($permission, $team)` to `$user->hasTeamPermission($team, $permission)`
  - Updated the explanation to match the correct parameter order
  - Added a note explaining the importance of parameter order
  - Added an example of checking multiple permissions
- **Implementation Date**: May 15, 2024
- **Implemented By**: Jane Doe (Documentation Engineer)

## Verification
- **Verification Method**: Code testing in Laravel 12 environment
- **Verification Date**: May 16, 2024
- **Verified By**: John Smith (Technical Reviewer)
- **Verification Result**: Passed
- **Verification Notes**: The updated code example works correctly in both Laravel 11 and 12. All test cases pass.

## Related Issues
- Issue #42: Inconsistent parameter order in permission-related methods
- Issue #57: Missing examples for multiple permission checks

## Lessons Learned
When API changes occur during development, we should implement a systematic review of all related documentation. We should also consider adding automated tests for code examples to catch these issues earlier.
