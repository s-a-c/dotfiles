## Verification Methods

The UME tutorial documentation uses several verification methods:

### Code Testing

Verify code examples by executing them in a test environment:

1. **Set up test environment**: Create an environment matching the documentation context
2. **Extract code examples**: Prepare code examples for testing
3. **Execute code**: Run the code and observe results
4. **Compare with expected results**: Verify that results match documentation
5. **Document test results**: Record testing outcomes

Implementation example:
```php
// Test environment setup
$testApp = new TestApplication();
$testApp->setUpDatabase();

// Code example from 010-consolidated-starter-kits
$user = User::create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('password')
]);

$customerType = CustomerType::create([
    'user_id' => $user->id,
    'company' => 'ACME Corp'
]);

$user->assignType($customerType);

// Verification
$this->assertTrue($user->isType(CustomerType::class));
$this->assertEquals('ACME Corp', $user->type->company);
```

### Source Code Review

Compare documentation with actual source code:

1. **Identify relevant source files**: Locate code related to documentation
2. **Extract key implementation details**: Identify important aspects of implementation
3. **Compare with documentation**: Check for discrepancies
4. **Note differences**: Document any inconsistencies
5. **Update documentation**: Align documentation with implementation

Implementation example:
```markdown
## Source Code Review: User Type Assignment

**Documentation Statement**: "The `assignType` method accepts any class that implements the `UserType` interface."

**Source Code** (app/Models/User.php):
```php
public function assignType($type)
{
    if (!$type instanceof UserType) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException(
            'Type must implement UserType interface'
        );
    }
    
    // Implementation details...
}
```

**Finding**: The documentation is accurate. The method does check that the passed type implements the `UserType` interface.

**Action Required**: None
```

### API Testing

Verify API documentation through direct API testing:

1. **Set up API test client**: Prepare tools for API testing
2. **Create test scenarios**: Define tests based on documentation
3. **Execute API calls**: Make requests according to documentation
4. **Verify responses**: Check that responses match documentation
5. **Document discrepancies**: Record any inconsistencies

Implementation example:
```php
// API test based on documentation
$response = $this->postJson('/api/users', [
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'password' => 'password',
    'password_confirmation' => 'password',
    'type' => 'customer',
    'company' => 'ACME Corp'
]);

// Verification
$response->assertStatus(201);
$response->assertJsonStructure([
    'data' => [
        'id',
        'name',
        'email',
        'type',
        'created_at'
    ]
]);
$response->assertJson([
    'data' => [
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
        'type' => 'customer'
    ]
]);
```

### Expert Review
