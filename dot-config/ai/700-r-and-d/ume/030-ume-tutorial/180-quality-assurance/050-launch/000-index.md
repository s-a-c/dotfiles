This section covers the launch process for the UME tutorial documentation. It provides guidance on executing a successful documentation release, monitoring initial performance, and addressing any issues that arise.

## Overview

The launch phase is when the documentation is officially released to users. It involves executing the launch plan, monitoring initial usage and feedback, and making any necessary adjustments to ensure a positive user experience from day one. This section outlines the processes and best practices for a successful documentation launch.

## In This Section

1. [Launch Execution](./010-launch-execution.md) - Executing the launch plan
2. [Initial Monitoring](./020-initial-monitoring.md) - Monitoring initial usage and performance
3. [Issue Resolution](./030-issue-resolution.md) - Addressing issues that arise after launch
4. [Post-Launch Assessment](./040-post-launch-assessment.md) - Evaluating launch success
5. [Transition to Maintenance](./050-maintenance-transition.md) - Moving to ongoing maintenance

## Launch Process

The documentation launch process follows these steps:

1. **Final Verification**: Confirm documentation is ready for release
2. **Launch Execution**: Deploy documentation and execute communications
3. **Initial Monitoring**: Track initial usage and gather feedback
4. **Issue Resolution**: Address any issues that arise
5. **Post-Launch Assessment**: Evaluate launch success
6. **Transition to Maintenance**: Shift to ongoing maintenance mode

## Launch Workflow

The UME documentation launch workflow consists of the following steps:
