**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

**Introduction (30 seconds):**
```
Hi, I'm [Name] from the [Team Name] team. Today, I'm excited to give you a quick tour of our completely revamped UME Tutorial Documentation.

We've made significant improvements based on your feedback to make the documentation more useful, more accessible, and easier to navigate. Let's take a look at what's new.
```

**Key Improvements Overview (60 seconds):**
```
We've redesigned the documentation with several key improvements:

First, we've completely reorganized the content to follow a more logical learning path, making it easier to find what you need.

Second, we've added interactive code examples throughout the documentation, allowing you to experiment with code right in your browser.

Third, we've enhanced the visual learning aids with diagrams, flowcharts, and animations to help explain complex concepts.

Fourth, we've improved the search functionality to help you find information faster.

And finally, we've optimized the entire experience for mobile devices, so you can access the documentation wherever you are.
```

**Feature Demonstration (90 seconds):**
```
Let me show you some of these features in action.

[SCREEN RECORDING: Homepage and navigation]
Here's the new homepage, with clear pathways for different learning journeys. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can quickly find the right starting point.

[SCREEN RECORDING: Search functionality]
The enhanced search now provides more relevant results and suggests related topics. Let's search for "authentication" to see how it works.

[SCREEN RECORDING: Interactive example]
Here's one of our new interactive code examples. You can edit the code right here in the documentation and run it to see the results. Let's make a change to this authentication example.

[SCREEN RECORDING: Visual aid]
And here's an example of our enhanced visual aids. This diagram shows the authentication flow, and you can see how each component interacts.

[SCREEN RECORDING: Mobile view]
Finally, here's how the documentation looks on a mobile device. All the same content and features are available, just optimized for a smaller screen.
```

**Conclusion and Call to Action (30 seconds):**
```
We're really excited about these improvements and hope they make your development experience better.
