4. **Resource Constraints**: Scale the dashboard complexity to match available resources for implementation and maintenance.

5. **User Needs**: Customize dashboards for different audiences (executives, documentation team, support team) with relevant metrics for each.

6. **Documentation Type**: Adjust metrics based on your documentation type (product documentation, API documentation, internal documentation, etc.).

7. **Tool Ecosystem**: Select implementation approaches that integrate with your existing tools and systems.

8. **Visualization Preferences**: Adapt visualization styles to match organizational standards and stakeholder preferences.

9. **Review Processes**: Align review frequency and participants with existing meeting cadences and team structures.
