# Documentation Retirement Process

This document provides a comprehensive guide for retiring documentation in a way that preserves knowledge, minimizes user disruption, and ensures a smooth transition. A well-planned retirement process is essential for maintaining documentation quality and user trust.

## What is Documentation Retirement?

Documentation retirement is the process of systematically removing or archiving documentation that is no longer relevant, accurate, or needed. This may include:

- Documentation for deprecated features
- Documentation for obsolete product versions
- Outdated tutorials or guides
- Redundant or superseded content
- Documentation for discontinued products or services

## When to Retire Documentation

Documentation should be considered for retirement when:

1. **The related feature or product has been deprecated or discontinued**
2. **The content has been superseded by newer, more accurate information**
3. **The content is redundant with other documentation**
4. **The content is no longer relevant to current users**
5. **The content is causing user confusion or support issues**
6. **The maintenance burden outweighs the value to users**
7. **Usage metrics indicate very low or no usage over an extended period**

   - Default to current version
   - Provide clear warnings for outdated versions

4. **Provide upgrade guidance**
   - Include migration information
   - Highlight feature changes between versions
   - Link to upgrade tutorials

### API Documentation

When retiring API documentation:

1. **Deprecation period**

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Feature Deprecation

**Scenario:**
A major feature is being deprecated after three years, with a new replacement feature available. The feature has moderate usage and extensive documentation.

**Approach:**
1. **Six months before deprecation:**
   - Add deprecation notices to documentation
   - Create migration guide to new feature
   - Begin user communication campaign

2. **Three months before deprecation:**
   - Increase visibility of notices
   - Conduct webinar on migration
   - Intensify targeted communications

3. **At deprecation:**
   - Move documentation to archived section
   - Implement redirects to new feature documentation
   - Update all cross-references

4. **Post-deprecation:**
   - Monitor migration success
   - Provide support for transition issues
   - Evaluate effectiveness of communication

**Results:**
- 85% of users successfully migrated before deprecation
- Minimal support impact
- Documentation team able to focus on new feature documentation
- Preserved knowledge for reference purposes

### Case Study 2: Documentation Consolidation

**Scenario:**
Multiple overlapping tutorials created over time have led to user confusion and maintenance challenges.

**Approach:**
1. **Assessment:**
   - Identify overlapping content
   - Map user journeys through current content
   - Design improved consolidated structure

2. **Preparation:**
   - Create new consolidated tutorials
   - Develop comprehensive cross-reference mapping
   - Prepare redirect strategy

3. **Communication:**
   - Inform users of upcoming improvements
   - Highlight benefits of consolidated approach
   - Provide preview access to get feedback

4. **Implementation:**
   - Deploy new consolidated content
   - Implement redirects from old tutorials
   - Update navigation and search

**Results:**
- 40% reduction in maintenance effort
- 25% improvement in user satisfaction
- Clearer learning paths for users
- Simplified navigation

### Case Study 3: Product End-of-Life

**Scenario:**
A product is reaching end-of-life with no direct replacement. Documentation has high historical value but will no longer be maintained.

**Approach:**
1. **12 months before EOL:**
   - Announce documentation retirement timeline
   - Begin developing preservation strategy
   - Identify critical knowledge to preserve

2. **6 months before EOL:**
   - Create archived documentation portal
   - Add clear EOL notices to all documentation
   - Begin transitioning users to alternatives

3. **At EOL:**
   - Move documentation to read-only archive
   - Implement access controls as needed
   - Ensure all preserved content is properly labeled

4. **Post-EOL:**
   - Maintain minimal archive maintenance
   - Provide access process for those needing historical information
   - Periodically review continued archive need

**Results:**
- Preserved valuable knowledge
- Clear expectations for users
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Complied with legal requirements

## Best Practices

### Planning and Strategy
- Develop a consistent retirement policy and process
- Align documentation retirement with product lifecycle
- Consider retirement during content creation
- Document retirement decisions and rationale
- Balance maintenance burden with user needs

### User-Centered Approach
- Prioritize user needs in retirement decisions

- Preserve URL structure when possible
- Consider SEO implications
- Test thoroughly before and after implementation

### Communication
- Be transparent about retirement reasons
- Communicate through multiple channels
- Provide clear timelines
- Offer support during transition
- Use consistent messaging across all channels

### Knowledge Preservation
- Preserve valuable knowledge even when retiring public documentation
- Consider internal knowledge bases for historical information
- Maintain version history in source control
- Document context and rationale, not just content
- Consider knowledge transfer to team members

## Conclusion

Documentation retirement is a critical part of the documentation lifecycle. When done properly, it:

1. Improves the overall quality of your documentation
2. Reduces maintenance burden
3. Minimizes user confusion
4. Preserves valuable knowledge
5. Maintains user trust through transparent communication

By following a structured process and considering user needs throughout, you can ensure that documentation retirement enhances rather than diminishes the value of your documentation ecosystem.

## Next Steps

After establishing your documentation retirement process:

1. Conduct an initial audit to identify retirement candidates
2. Develop a retirement schedule aligned with product roadmap
3. Create templates and tools to support the process
4. Train documentation team on the retirement process
5. Implement regular review cycles to identify future candidates
6. Measure and refine the process based on results
