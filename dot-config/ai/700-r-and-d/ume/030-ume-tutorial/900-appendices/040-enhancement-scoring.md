# Enhancement Scoring Matrix

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/css/styles.css">

This appendix provides a scoring matrix for the potential User Model enhancements listed in [Future User Model Enhancements](./030-future-enhancements.md). Each enhancement is scored based on four criteria:

1. **Application Feature Value (%)**: The practical value the enhancement adds to the application
2. **Understanding Principles (%)**: How much the enhancement reinforces understanding of principles covered in the tutorial
3. **New Principles/Topics (%)**: How many new principles or topics the enhancement introduces
4. **Implementation Effort (%)**: The relative effort required to implement the enhancement (higher % = more effort)
