## Issues Addressed

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

1. **Code Highlighting**
   - **Issue**: Syntax highlighting inconsistencies in Safari
   - **Resolution**: Updated Prism.js configuration to ensure consistent highlighting across browsers
   - **Status**: Resolved

2. **Font Rendering**
   - **Issue**: Monospace fonts appeared differently across browsers
   - **Resolution**: Implemented a more consistent font stack with fallbacks
   - **Status**: Resolved

3. **JavaScript Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Some ES6+ features not supported in older browsers
   - **Resolution**: Added Babel transpilation for backward compatibility
   - **Status**: Resolved

4. **CSS Flexbox/Grid**
   - **Issue**: Layout inconsistencies in older browsers
   - **Resolution**: Added appropriate vendor prefixes and fallbacks
   - **Status**: Resolved

### Accessibility Improvements

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - **Issue**: Tab order was not intuitive in interactive examples
   - **Resolution**: Improved focus management and tab indices
   - **Status**: Resolved

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - **Issue**: Code examples not properly announced by screen readers
   - **Resolution**: Added appropriate ARIA attributes and improved semantic markup
   - **Status**: Resolved

3. **Color Contrast**
   - **Issue**: Some syntax highlighting colors had insufficient contrast
   - **Resolution**: Adjusted color palette to meet WCAG AA standards
   - **Status**: Resolved

## Performance Considerations

1. **Load Time**
   - Implemented code splitting to reduce initial load time
   - Deferred loading of non-critical resources
   - Compressed and minified assets

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Optimized JavaScript to reduce memory footprint
   - Implemented virtualization for large code examples

## Fallback Mechanisms

For browsers that don't fully support all features, the following fallbacks have been implemented:

1. **Static Code Display**: If interactive features fail, code is still displayed as static content
2. **Simplified Styling**: Reduced CSS complexity for older browsers
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages when features are not supported

## Conclusion

All interactive code examples now function consistently across the tested browsers. The implementation prioritizes progressive enhancement to ensure that core functionality is available even in browsers with limited feature support.

## Recommendations

1. Continue monitoring for browser updates that might affect compatibility
2. Consider implementing automated cross-browser testing using tools like BrowserStack or Selenium
3. Collect user feedback specifically related to browser compatibility issues
