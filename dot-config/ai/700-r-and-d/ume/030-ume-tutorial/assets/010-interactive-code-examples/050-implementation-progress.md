## Implementation Details

### Monaco Editor Integration

The interactive code examples use Monaco Editor (the editor that powers VS Code) for a rich code editing experience:

- Syntax highlighting for PHP
- Code completion
- Error checking
- Dark/light mode support

### Interactive Features

Each example includes:

- Editable code area
- Run button to execute code
- Reset button to restore original code
- Copy button to copy code to clipboard
- Output panel to display results
- Explanation section
- Challenges section

### User Experience Considerations

- Examples are designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices
- Code is pre-populated with working examples
- Clear instructions and explanations are provided
- Progressive challenges encourage experimentation
- Local storage saves user modifications between sessions
