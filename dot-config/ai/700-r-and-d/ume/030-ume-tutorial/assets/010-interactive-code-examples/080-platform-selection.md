# Interactive Code Examples Platform Selection

## Requirements

For the UME tutorial, we need an interactive code example platform that:

1. Supports PHP and Laravel code
2. Allows embedding in Markdown documentation
3. Provides a good user experience in both light and dark modes
4. Allows users to edit and run code examples
5. Supports saving user modifications
6. Is easy to maintain and update

## Platform Options

### 1. CodeSandbox

**Pros:**
- Well-established platform with good stability
- Supports multiple files and complex projects
- Good embedding options
- Excellent UI with light/dark mode support

**Cons:**
- Better for JavaScript than PHP
- Requires external configuration for Laravel

### 2. Replit

**Pros:**
- Good support for PHP
- Full development environment
- Collaborative features
- Embeddable

**Cons:**
- Can be slow to load
- UI is more complex than needed for simple examples

### 3. JSFiddle/PHPFiddle

**Pros:**
- Simple and focused
- Easy to embed
- Lightweight

**Cons:**
- Limited Laravel support
- Basic features only

### 4. Custom Solution with Monaco Editor

**Pros:**
- Full control over the experience
- Can be optimized for Laravel and PHP
- Seamless integration with documentation
- Can be styled to match UME documentation

**Cons:**
- Requires more development effort
- Need to maintain our own solution

## Recommendation

For the UME tutorial, we recommend using a **custom solution based on the Monaco Editor** (the editor that powers VS Code) for the following reasons:

1. **Tailored Experience**: We can create an experience specifically designed for Laravel and PHP examples
2. **Seamless Integration**: The editor can be styled to match our documentation perfectly
3. **Performance**: We can optimize loading times and resource usage
4. **Control**: We can add specific features needed for UME examples
5. **Maintenance**: While it requires more upfront work, it will be easier to maintain alongside the documentation

## Implementation Approach

1. Use Monaco Editor as the code editing component
2. Create a simple PHP execution backend using Laravel Playground or a similar approach
3. Develop a custom component that can be embedded in our Markdown files
4. Style the component to match our documentation in both light and dark modes
5. Add features for saving user modifications locally

## Next Steps

1. Set up the Monaco Editor in our documentation assets
2. Create a basic PHP execution backend
3. Develop the embedding mechanism
4. Test with simple examples
5. Expand to more complex Laravel examples
