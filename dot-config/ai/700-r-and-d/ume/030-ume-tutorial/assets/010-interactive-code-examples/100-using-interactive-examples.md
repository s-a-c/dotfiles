# Using the Interactive Code Examples

This guide explains how to effectively use the interactive code examples provided in the UME tutorial.

## What Are Interactive Code Examples?

Interactive code examples are code snippets that you can:

1. **Read**: Study the code and explanations to understand the concepts
2. **Edit**: Modify the code to experiment with different approaches
3. **Run**: Execute the code to see the results (where applicable)
4. **Challenge**: Try the suggested challenges to deepen your understanding

## Interface Elements

Each interactive code example includes the following elements:

- **Title**: Describes the main concept being demonstrated
- **Description**: Provides context and explains the purpose of the example
- **Code Editor**: Shows the code with syntax highlighting and allows editing
- **Explanation**: Detailed explanation of the code and concepts
- **Challenges**: Optional tasks to extend your learning

## How to Use the Examples

### Reading the Code

1. Start by reading the title and description to understand the purpose of the example
2. Review the code in the editor, paying attention to comments that explain specific parts
3. Read the explanation section for a detailed breakdown of the concepts and implementation

### Editing the Code

1. Click in the code editor to make changes
2. Try modifying variables, function parameters, or logic to see how it affects the behavior
3. Add or remove code to experiment with different approaches
4. Use the editor's features like syntax highlighting and auto-indentation

### Running the Code

1. Click the "Run" button to execute the code
2. Observe the output in the results panel
3. If there are errors, read the error messages and try to fix the issues
4. Make changes and run again to see how they affect the results

### Trying the Challenges

1. Read the challenges section at the bottom of each example
2. Choose a challenge that interests you
3. Modify the code to implement the challenge
4. Run the code to verify your solution
5. If you get stuck, refer to the explanation or try a different approach

## Tips for Effective Learning

1. **Experiment Freely**: Don't be afraid to make changes and see what happens
2. **Read the Explanations**: The explanations provide valuable context and insights
3. **Try All Challenges**: The challenges are designed to reinforce and extend your learning
4. **Compare Approaches**: Try different ways to solve the same problem
5. **Take Notes**: Write down key concepts and insights as you work through the examples
6. **Build on Examples**: Use the examples as starting points for your own projects

## Troubleshooting

### Code Doesn't Run

- Check for syntax errors (missing semicolons, brackets, etc.)
- Verify that all required variables and functions are defined
- Look for error messages in the console or output panel

### Example Doesn't Load

- Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache

### Changes Don't Take Effect

- Make sure you've clicked the "Run" button after making changes
- Check that your changes are within the editable regions
- Verify that your changes don't contain syntax errors

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For a more efficient experience, you can use these keyboard shortcuts:

- **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on Mac): Run the code
- **Ctrl+Z** (or **Cmd+Z** on Mac): Undo changes
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z** (or **Cmd+Shift+Z** on Mac): Redo changes
- **Ctrl+/** (or **Cmd+/** on Mac): Comment/uncomment selected lines
- **Tab**: Indent selected lines
- **Shift+Tab**: Unindent selected lines

## Accessibility Features

These interactive examples include several accessibility features:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All functions can be accessed via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Compatible with popular screen readers
- **High Contrast Mode**: Available for better visibility
- **Resizable Text**: Text size can be adjusted in your browser settings
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for keyboard focus

## Feedback and Support

If you encounter issues with the interactive examples or have suggestions for improvements, please:

1. Check the [Browser Compatibility Report](browser-compatibility-report.md) and [Device Compatibility Report](device-compatibility-report.md)
2. Submit an issue or pull request to the repository
3. Contact the tutorial maintainers for assistance
