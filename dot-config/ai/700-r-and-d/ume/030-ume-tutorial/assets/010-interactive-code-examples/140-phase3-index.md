# Phase 3: Advanced User Management

This index provides an overview of the interactive code examples for Phase 3 of the UME tutorial, focusing on role-based access control and user types in Laravel applications.

## Examples in this Phase

1. [Role Management](phase3-01-role-management.md)
   - Role model implementation
   - Role assignment and removal
   - Role hierarchy
   - Role-based access control

2. [Permission Management](phase3-02-permission-management.md)
   - Permission model implementation
   - Permission assignment to roles
   - Direct permission assignment to users
   - Permission checking and validation

3. [Team Management](phase3-03-team-management.md)
   - Team model implementation
   - Team membership management
   - Team-specific roles and permissions
   - Team-based authorization

4. [User Type Management](phase3-04-user-type-management.md)
   - User type implementation
   - Type transitions and history
   - Type-specific functionality
   - Type-based authorization

5. [Permission Caching](phase3-05-permission-caching.md)
   - Caching strategies for permissions
   - Cache invalidation
   - Performance optimization
   - Cache drivers and configuration

## Key Concepts

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Controlling access based on user roles
- **Permissions**: Granular access controls for specific actions
- **Teams**: Grouping users for collaboration and access control
- **User Types**: Categorizing users for different functionality
- **Caching**: Improving performance for permission checks

## Prerequisites

Before working through these examples, you should have:

1. Completed [Phase 0](phase0-index.md), [Phase 1](phase1-index.md), and [Phase 2](phase2-index.md)
2. Understanding of Laravel's authorization system
3. Familiarity with database relationships
4. Basic knowledge of caching concepts

## Next Steps

After completing these examples, you should be able to:

1. Implement a comprehensive role and permission system
2. Create team-based collaboration features
3. Build a user type system with transitions
4. Optimize permission checks with caching
5. Implement advanced authorization rules
