# Phase 7: Deployment and Maintenance

This index provides an overview of the interactive code examples for Phase 7 of the UME tutorial, focusing on deployment and maintenance strategies for Laravel applications with user model enhancements.

## Examples in this Phase

1. [Deployment Strategies](phase7-01-deployment-strategies.md)
   - Standard deployment with maintenance mode
   - Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
   - Canary deployment for gradual rollout

2. [Monitoring and Logging](phase7-02-monitoring-logging.md)
   - Centralized monitoring service
   - Metrics collection and analysis
   - Structured logging with multiple channels
   - Alerting system for issues

3. Backup and Recovery (3-part example)
   - [Part 1: Database Backup](phase7-03-backup-recovery-part1.md)
   - [Part 2: File Backup](phase7-03-backup-recovery-part2.md)
   - [Part 3: Restoration Process](phase7-03-backup-recovery-part3.md)

4. [Scaling Considerations](phase7-04-scaling-considerations.md)
   - Caching strategies for user data
   - Database sharding for horizontal scaling
   - Read/write splitting for optimized performance
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

5. [Maintenance and Updates](phase7-05-maintenance-updates.md)
   - Enhanced maintenance mode
   - Feature flag system for gradual rollout
   - Safe database migrations
   - Zero-downtime updates

## Key Concepts

- **Zero-Downtime Operations**: Techniques to minimize or eliminate downtime during updates and maintenance
- **Scalability**: Approaches to handle growing user bases and traffic
- **Reliability**: Strategies to ensure system stability and data integrity
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Methods to gain insights into system behavior and performance
- **Backup and Recovery**: Procedures to protect against data loss and enable quick recovery
- **Gradual Rollout**: Techniques to safely introduce new features and changes
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategies to maintain performance as the application grows
