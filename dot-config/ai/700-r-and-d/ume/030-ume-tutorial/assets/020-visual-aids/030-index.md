## How to Use These Visual Aids

Each visual aid is designed to complement the written documentation. To get the most out of these aids:

1. Read the corresponding documentation section first
2. Use the visual aid to reinforce your understanding
3. Refer back to the visual aid when implementing the feature

All diagrams support both light and dark modes and will automatically adjust based on your system preferences.
