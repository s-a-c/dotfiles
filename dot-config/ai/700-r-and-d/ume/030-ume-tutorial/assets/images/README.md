# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the UME tutorial documentation, including:

- Diagrams illustrating architecture and relationships
- Screenshots of UI components and interfaces
- Icons and other visual elements

Images should be organized by section and named descriptively to make them easy to find and use.
