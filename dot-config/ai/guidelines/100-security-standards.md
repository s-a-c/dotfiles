# 9. Security Standards

## 9.1. Core Security Principle

**All security implementations should be clear, verifiable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand, implement, and maintain.**

This principle ensures that security measures are not only effective but also maintainable and auditable by team members at all experience levels.

## 9.2. Authentication and Authorization

### 9.2.1. Laravel Authentication System

#### 9.2.1.1. Built-in Authentication
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication system as the foundation
- Implement Laravel Breeze or Jetstream for starter authentication scaffolding
- Never build custom authentication from scratch without compelling reasons
- Follow Laravel's authentication conventions and naming patterns

#### 9.2.1.2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implement MFA for all administrative accounts
- Use Laravel Fortify for two-factor authentication features
- Support TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) applications
- Provide backup recovery codes for account recovery

#### 9.2.1.3. Password Security
- Enforce strong password requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
  - No common dictionary words or patterns
- Use Laravel's built-in password validation rules
- Implement password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords
- Set password expiration policies for sensitive accounts

### 9.2.2. FilamentShield Integration

#### 9.2.2.1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Use FilamentShield for comprehensive permission management
- Define roles based on business functions, not technical access levels
- Implement principle of least privilege - grant minimum necessary permissions
- Regular audit and review of role assignments

#### 9.2.2.2. Permission Structure
```php
// Example permission structure
'permissions' => [
    'view_invoices',
    'create_invoices', 
    'edit_invoices',
    'delete_invoices',
    'approve_invoices',
    'export_invoices'
]
```

#### 9.2.2.3. Resource-Level Security
- Implement resource-level permissions for FilamentPHP resources
- Use policy classes for complex authorization logic
- Ensure consistent permission checking across all admin interfaces

### 9.2.3. Session Management

#### 9.2.3.1. Session Configuration
- Use secure session configuration in production:
  - `SESSION_SECURE=true` for HTTPS-only cookies
  - `SESSION_HTTP_ONLY=true` to prevent XSS access
  - `SESSION_SAME_SITE=strict` for CSRF protection
- Set appropriate session lifetime based on security requirements
- Implement session regeneration on authentication state changes

#### 9.2.3.2. Session Security
- Invalidate sessions on password changes
- Implement concurrent session limits for high-security accounts
- Log and monitor suspicious session activities
- Provide users with active session management capabilities

## 9.3. Data Protection

### 9.3.1. Data Encryption

#### 9.3.1.1. Encryption at Rest

- Example implementation:
```php
// Model with encrypted attributes
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    protected $casts = [
        'social_security_number' => 'encrypted',
        'bank_account' => 'encrypted',
    ];
}
```

#### 9.3.1.2. Encryption in Transit
- Enforce HTTPS for all connections in production
- Use TLS 1.3 or higher for all external communications
- Implement certificate pinning for critical API connections
- Validate SSL certificates and reject invalid connections

### 9.3.2. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### 9.3.2.1. Request Validation
- Use Laravel's Form Request validation for all user inputs
- Implement whitelist-based validation (define what is allowed)
- Validate data types, formats, and ranges explicitly
- Example validation rules:
```php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'email' => ['required', 'email:rfc,dns', 'max:255'],
        'amount' => ['required', 'numeric', 'min:0.01', 'max:999999.99'],
        'status' => ['required', 'in:pending,approved,rejected'],
    ];
}
```

#### 9.3.2.2. Output Sanitization
- Use Blade templating engine's automatic escaping
- Explicitly escape data when using `{!! !!}` syntax
- Sanitize data before storing in database
- Validate and sanitize file uploads rigorously

### 9.3.3. Database Security

#### 9.3.3.1. Query Protection
- Use Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Avoid raw SQL queries; when necessary, use parameter binding
- Implement database query logging and monitoring
- Use read-only database connections for reporting queries

#### 9.3.3.2. Database Access Control
- Use separate database users for different application components
- Implement database-level access controls and permissions
- Regular database security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Encrypt database backups and secure backup storage

## 9.4. Web Application Security

### 9.4.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- Use Blade templating with automatic escaping by default
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Validate and sanitize all user-generated content
- Use Laravel's built-in XSS protection mechanisms

### 9.4.2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- Enable CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Use Laravel's built-in CSRF middleware
- Implement proper CSRF token handling in AJAX requests
- Validate CSRF tokens on all form submissions

### 9.4.3. Security Headers
Implement comprehensive security headers:
```php
// Example security headers configuration
'headers' => [
    'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff',
    'X-Frame-Options' => 'DENY',
    'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block',
    'Strict-Transport-Security' => 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
    'Content-Security-Policy' => "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
    'Referrer-Policy' => 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
]
```
