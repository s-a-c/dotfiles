    use Userstamps;
    // ... additional traits
}
```

**Strengths:**
- **Trait Composition:** Excellent use of Laravel traits for cross-cutting concerns

- **Modern Patterns:** Uses casts() method and current Laravel syntax
- **Enterprise Features:** Comprehensive audit trail and soft deletes

**Validation:**
- ✅ Follows Laravel best practices
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable across all models
- ⚠️ Trait naming needs verification (HasTaxonomy vs HasTaxonomies)

#### Relationship Design (GOOD - 85% Confidence)
**Polymorphic Taxonomy Relationships:**
- Clean polymorphic implementation through taxables table
- Flexible assignment of terms to any model
- Efficient querying with proper indexing

**Traditional Relationships:**
- Standard Laravel relationship patterns
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Good use of relationship methods

### Database Design (GOOD - 80% Confidence)

#### Schema Architecture
