## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Immediate Priorities (Week 1-2)
- **Complete Filament Resources**: Implement all 11 admin panel resources
- **Finish Test Suite**: Complete comprehensive Pest PHP test coverage
- **Frontend Development**: Build Livewire/Volt components

### 2. Secondary Priorities (Week 3-4)
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and query optimization
- **Production Deployment**: Finalize deployment strategies and CI/CD
- **Documentation Updates**: Update implementation guides with actual code

### 3. Quality Gates
- **95%+ Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing before production
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Accessibility validation
- **Performance Benchmarks**: SQLite optimization and query performance

---

## Risk Assessment: LOW RISK

**Primary Risks:**
1. **Timeline Pressure**: Ambitious 4-week timeline may need adjustment
2. **Complexity Management**: Large number of packages requires careful integration
3. **Performance Optimization**: SQLite performance under load needs validation

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Phased Delivery**: Prioritize core functionality first
2. **Package Integration Testing**: Comprehensive integration testing
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Early performance testing and optimization
