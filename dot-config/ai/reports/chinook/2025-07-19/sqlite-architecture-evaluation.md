```php
'connections' => [
    'sqlite' => [
        'driver' => 'sqlite',
        'database' => database_path('database.sqlite'),
        'foreign_key_constraints' => true,
        // Main app optimizations
    ],
    
    'cache' => [
        'driver' => 'sqlite',
        'database' => ':memory:',
        'foreign_key_constraints' => false,
        // Memory-optimized settings
    ],
    
    'chinook' => [
        'driver' => 'sqlite', 
        'database' => database_path('chinook.sqlite'),
        'foreign_key_constraints' => true,
        // Read-optimized with FTS5/Vector extensions
    ],
],
```

**Consistency Requirements:**
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Ensure all databases represent same time point
- **Cross-Database Integrity:** Maintain referential integrity across backups
- **Atomic Backup Operations:** All-or-nothing backup completion

**Recommended Backup Strategy:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Multi-database backup script

# 1. Checkpoint all WAL files
sqlite3 database/database.sqlite "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);"
sqlite3 database/chinook.sqlite "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);"

# 2. Create consistent backup timestamp
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# 3. Backup all databases atomically
cp database/database.sqlite "backups/database_${TIMESTAMP}.sqlite"
cp database/chinook.sqlite "backups/chinook_${TIMESTAMP}.sqlite"

# 4. Verify backup integrity
sqlite3 "backups/database_${TIMESTAMP}.sqlite" "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 "backups/chinook_${TIMESTAMP}.sqlite" "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

#### 6.1.2. Monitoring and Logging

**Enhanced Monitoring Requirements:**
- **Connection Pool Status:** Monitor connections to each database
- **WAL File Sizes:** Track WAL growth across all databases
- **Query Performance:** Monitor cross-database operation performance
- **Cache Hit Rates:** Track cache database effectiveness

**Logging Strategy:**
```php
// Enhanced database logging
DB::listen(function ($query) {
    Log::info('Database Query', [
        'connection' => $query->connectionName,
        'sql' => $query->sql,
        'time' => $query->time,
        'bindings' => $query->bindings,
    ]);
});
```

```bash
# Database file permissions
chmod 640 database/database.sqlite
chmod 640 database/chinook.sqlite
chown www-data:www-data database/*.sqlite

# Backup security
chmod 600 backups/*.sqlite
chown backup:backup backups/*.sqlite
```

#### 6.2.2. Encryption Considerations

**Current State:** No encryption (SQLite limitation)  
**Proposed State:** File-system level encryption recommended

**Options:**
- **File System Encryption:** Encrypt entire database directory
- **Application-Level Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive fields before storage
