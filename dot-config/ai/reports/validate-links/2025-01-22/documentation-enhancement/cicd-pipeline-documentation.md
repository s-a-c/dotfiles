```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Monitoring

#### GitHub Actions Dashboard
- Monitor workflow execution status
- Review job logs and artifacts
- Track success/failure rates
- Identify bottlenecks and failures

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Build Success Rate:** Target >95%
- **Average Build Time:** Target <10 minutes
- **Test Success Rate:** Target 100%
- **Deployment Frequency:** Track deployment cadence
- **Mean Time to Recovery:** Target <30 minutes

### Debugging Procedures

#### Workflow Failure Investigation
```bash
# 1. Check GitHub Actions logs
# Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub repository
# Select failed workflow run
# Review job logs and error messages

# 2. Local Reproduction
git checkout <failing-commit>
composer install
composer quality  # Reproduce quality checks
composer test     # Reproduce test failures

# 3. Environment Debugging
# Check PHP version compatibility
php -v
# Verify extensions
php -m | grep -E "(curl|mbstring|json)"
```

#### Common Issues and Solutions

##### 1. Composer Dependency Issues
```bash
# Problem: Dependency resolution failures
# Solution:
composer clear-cache
rm -rf vendor/ composer.lock
composer install

# Problem: Memory limit exceeded
# Solution:
php -d memory_limit=2G composer install
```

##### 2. Test Failures
```bash
# Problem: Tests failing in CI but passing locally
# Solution:
# Check environment differences
# Verify .env.example exists and is correct
# Check database/cache configuration

# Problem: Parallel test failures
# Solution:
vendor/bin/pest --no-parallel
```

##### 3. Asset Build Failures
```bash
# Problem: NPM build failures
# Solution:
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules/ package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

##### 4. Deployment Failures
```bash
# Problem: SSH connection issues
# Solution:
# Verify DEPLOY_KEY secret is correct
# Check server SSH configuration
# Validate deploy.php configuration

# Problem: Permission issues
# Solution:
# Check file permissions on server
# Verify deploy user permissions
# Update directory ownership
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Workflow Optimization Strategies
1. **Dependency Caching**
   - Composer cache for PHP dependencies
   - NPM cache for Node.js dependencies
   - Docker layer caching (if applicable)

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Run independent jobs in parallel
   - Utilize matrix builds for multiple environments
   - Optimize test execution with parallel runners

3. **Artifact Management**
   - Cache build artifacts between jobs
   - Minimize artifact size
   - Clean up old artifacts regularly

#### Example Optimized Workflow
```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Cache Dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            vendor/
            node_modules/
          key: deps-${{ hashFiles('composer.lock', 'package-lock.json') }}

  quality:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        check: [pint, phpstan, rector, insights]
    steps:
      - name: Run ${{ matrix.check }}
        run: composer ${{ matrix.check }}
```

## Security Considerations

### Secret Management
- Rotate deployment keys regularly
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Implement least-privilege access
- Monitor secret usage and access

### Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Container security (if applicable)
- Infrastructure security validation

### Compliance Requirements
- Audit trail maintenance
- Change approval processes
- Security review gates
- Compliance reporting

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Weekly:** Review workflow performance metrics
- **Monthly:** Update GitHub Actions versions
- **Quarterly:** Review and optimize workflow configurations
- **Annually:** Security audit and secret rotation
