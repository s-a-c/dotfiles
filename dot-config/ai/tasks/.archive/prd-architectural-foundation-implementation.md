# Product Requirements Document: Architectural Foundation Implementation

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the architectural foundation of a Laravel application based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and modern architectural patterns. This foundation establishes the core architectural components necessary for building a scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich application.

The goal is to create a solid foundation that incorporates event sourcing, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), finite state machines, and other advanced patterns while adhering to Laravel's standard conventions for file naming and structure.

## 2. Prioritized Implementation Goals

1. **Composer Package Installation and Configuration**: Ensure all required composer packages are installed and properly configured to provide a stable platform with all necessary capabilities.
2. **Filament Packages/Plugins Implementation**: Configure and implement all Filament packages and plugins to provide a comprehensive admin interface.
3. **STI User Model Implementation**: Implement a Single Table Inheritance User model with proper type hierarchy and tenant awareness.
4. **STI Self-Hierarchical Organisation Model**: Implement a Single Table Inheritance, self-referential Organisation model with proper type hierarchy and adjacency list capabilities.
5. **Remaining Foundational Tasks**: Complete all other foundational architectural components to ensure a robust application architecture.

## 3. User Stories

### Core Architecture Team

- As an architect, I want to implement a hybrid Event Sourcing approach so that we can maintain a complete audit trail while leveraging both modern and mature packages.
- As a developer, I want clear separation between read and write operations so that I can optimize each independently.
- As a team lead, I want to establish Domain-Driven Design principles so that our codebase aligns with business domains and is more maintainable.
- As a developer, I want to use Finite State Machines for state management so that state transitions are type-safe and predictable.
- As a database administrator, I want a multi-tier identifier strategy so that we can optimize for different use cases while maintaining performance.

### Application Developers

- As an application developer, I want to use pre-built aggregates and projections so that I can quickly implement business logic without reinventing the wheel.
- As a frontend developer, I want optimized read models so that I can efficiently retrieve and display data.
- As a QA engineer, I want the ability to replay events so that I can reproduce and debug issues more effectively.
- As a security specialist, I want built-in security features so that our applications are protected against common vulnerabilities.

### Operations Team

- As an operations engineer, I want performance optimization strategies so that our applications can handle high traffic loads.
- As a DevOps specialist, I want scalability features so that we can grow our infrastructure as needed.
- As a monitoring specialist, I want built-in health checks so that we can proactively identify and address issues.

   - ULIDs for external references
   - UUIDs for security-sensitive contexts

36. The system must integrate with `glhd/bits` for Snowflake ID generation.

37. The system must integrate with `symfony/uid` for UUID and ULID generation.

38. The system must implement proper identifier generation services and interfaces.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
