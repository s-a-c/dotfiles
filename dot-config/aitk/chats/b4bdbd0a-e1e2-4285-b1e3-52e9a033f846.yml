            Here's the **Best Option (Enhanced Option 3):**


            ```prompt

            Imagine you are creating documentation specifically for **novice
            developers** who are just starting to work with a Laravel 12
            application at `@codebase`.  Your goal is to produce a Markdown
            document that will be their friendly guide to understanding and
            contributing to this project.  This document should be:


            * **Comprehensive (but not overwhelming):**  Cover the essential
            parts of the application that a new developer needs to know,
            focusing on the most important concepts first.

            * **Detailed (but easy to follow):** Provide enough depth to
            understand, but explain things in a step-by-step, beginner-friendly
            way, avoiding jargon where possible.

            * **Practical (hands-on guidance):**  Offer clear, step-by-step
            instructions for common development tasks they will likely
            encounter.

            with clear headings so they can quickly find the information they
            need.


            **Document Outline:**


            1. **Welcome to the Application! (Unnumbered Level 1 Heading):**
                * Start with a friendly, non-technical introduction to the application. What does it do? What problem does it solve?
                * Briefly explain the purpose of this documentation and how it will help them.
                * Use a simple Mermaid diagram (if possible) to give a very high-level overview of the application's main parts (like "Users," "Teams," "Content" -  keep it conceptual).

            2. **Getting Started with the Codebase (Numbered Level 2 Headings
            and Below):**
                * 1. Project Structure: Explain how the project files and folders are organized in a way that's easy for someone new to understand. Highlight the key directories like `app`, `routes`, `resources`, `database`.
                * 2.  Understanding the Database (Data Model): Explain the basics of the database. What are the main tables (like `users`, `teams`) and how are they related? A simple Mermaid diagram showing key tables and relationships would be very helpful.
                * 3.  How Requests Work (Routing): Explain in simple terms how URLs in the browser get directed to different parts of the application. A very basic Mermaid diagram of the routing flow could be useful.
                * 4.  Controllers: Explain what controllers do in a beginner-friendly way (like "the traffic cops of the application"). Give examples of key controllers and their jobs.
                * 5.  Models: Explain what models represent (like "blueprints for database tables"). Describe important models and what data they handle.
                * 6.  Views: Explain how views are used to display information to the user. Introduce Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro as the tools used for creating views in this project, but keep it high-level for now.
                * 7.  Key Services (if any): If there are important service classes, explain what they do in plain language.
                * 8.  Tools We Use (Technology Stack): Briefly list the main technologies used (Laravel, Volt, Flux/Flux-Pro, Folio) and *especially emphasize the use of Laravel's built-in features and first-party packages whenever possible*.

            3. **Step-by-Step Guides: Building Common Features (Numbered Level 2
            Headings and Below):**

            **Important Formatting and Technology Rules:**


            * **Markdown Format:**  Save the document as a standard Markdown
            file (e.g., `docs/getting_started.md`).

            * **Numbered Headings (mostly):** Use numbered headings (starting
            from level 2) for sections within "Getting Started with the
            Codebase" and "Step-by-Step Guides."  The "Welcome" section is
            unnumbered to feel more like an introduction.

            * **Code Blocks with Language:**  Always use code blocks (code
            fences) for code examples and clearly specify the language (e.g.,
            ```php, ```html, ```javascript).

            * **Visual Aids (Mermaid Diagrams):**  Use simple Mermaid diagrams
            to illustrate things like database relationships, routing flow, or
            high-level application structure.  Keep diagrams easy to understand
            for beginners.

            * **Volt Views for New Pages:** Any new views you create must be
            Volt functional components.

            * **Flux/Flux-Pro Components for Views:**  For building the user
            interface in new views, use only Flux and Flux-Pro components.

            * **Folio for Routing:**  All routing must be done using Folio
            page-based routing, placing:
                * Guest pages in `resources/views/pages/guest/`
                * Logged-in user pages in `resources/views/pages/resident/`
            * **Prioritize Laravel First-Party Features:** *Whenever possible*,
            use Laravel's built-in features and official first-party packages
            for implementing functionality. This is especially important for
            novice developers as it aligns with standard Laravel practices and
            easier to maintain.


            **Explain Your Thinking (Reasoning):**  Throughout the
            documentation, briefly explain *why* you are doing things a certain
            way or why a particular approach is recommended. This helps novice
            developers learn the "why" behind the code, not just the "how."


            **Write in a Friendly and Encouraging Tone:** Remember you are
            writing for beginners. Use clear, simple language, avoid technical
            jargon where possible, and be encouraging!  Imagine you are a
            friendly senior developer helping a junior developer get started.


            Let's create some fantastic and helpful documentation!

            ```


            **Key Improvements in the Best Option:**


            * **Target Audience Focus - Novice Developers is Central:** The
            prompt is framed entirely around creating documentation *for* novice
            developers, influencing every aspect of the requested output.

            * **Simplified Language and Tone:**  Uses more beginner-friendly
            language and emphasizes a friendly, encouraging tone.

            * **"Welcome to the Application!" Section:** Adds a friendly,
            non-technical introduction to ease beginners into the documentation.

            * **"Getting Started" Framing:**  Sections are framed as "Getting
            Started" and "Step-by-Step Guides," which are more approachable for
            novices.

            * **Emphasis on Laravel First-Party Packages:** Explicitly adds the
            constraint to prioritize Laravel's built-in features and first-party
            packages, crucial for best practices and beginner learning.

            * **Clarity on Diagrams:**  Specifically instructs to keep Mermaid
            diagrams simple and beginner-friendly.

            * **"Explain Your Thinking" (Reasoning) - Emphasized:**  Highlights
            the importance of explaining the "why" for educational purposes.

            * **Overall Goal - Friendly Guide:**  Reinforces the idea that the
            documentation should be a friendly guide, not just a technical
            manual.


            This enhanced Option 3 is the most effective because it is
            specifically tailored to the needs and understanding level of novice
            developers, making the generated documentation much more valuable
            and helpful for them.

                * Clearly state the *goal* of this documentation: to help novice developers get up to speed quickly and confidently.
                * Use a *very simple* Mermaid diagram to provide a high-level, conceptual overview of the application's main areas (e.g., "Users," "Data," "Content Management"). Keep it visual and non-intimidating.

            2. **Understanding the Codebase: A Beginner's Guide (Numbered Level
            2 Headings and Below):**
                * 1. Project Files and Folders:  Explain the project structure like a guided tour.  Describe the *purpose* of key directories (e.g., `app`, `routes`, `resources`, `database`) in plain language.  What kind of code lives in each folder?
                * 2.  Working with Data: The Database Explained:  Introduce the database in a beginner-friendly way.  What is a database? Why do we need one? Explain the main database tables (like `users`, `teams`, etc.) and their relationships using a **Mermaid diagram to visualize the database schema clearly**. Focus on the *business meaning* of the data.
                * 3.  How the Application Listens and Responds: Routing Basics:  Explain routing in simple terms. How do URLs in the browser lead to different parts of the application? Use a **Mermaid diagram to illustrate a *typical* user journey/routing flow**, keeping it straightforward.
                * 4.  Controllers: The Application's Decision Makers: Explain what controllers *do* using an analogy (e.g., "traffic controllers," "orchestrators").  Describe the *role* of key controllers in handling user requests and actions.
                * 5.  Models: Representing Data in Code:  Explain models as representations of database tables in code.  Describe important models and their attributes in terms that a beginner can grasp.
                * 6.  Views: Building the User Interface with Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro: Introduce Views as what users see. Explain how Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro are used to build interactive components, emphasizing the *benefits* of component-based UI for maintainability and organization (without getting too technical).
                * 7.  Services: Organizing Complex Logic (If Applicable): If services are used, explain their purpose as a way to organize and reuse complex parts of the application's logic, using a simple analogy if possible.
                * 8.  External Tools: Key Packages We Use: List and *briefly explain* the most important third-party packages. Focus on *why* these packages were chosen and what problem they solve for the application in a practical sense.

            3. **Step-by-Step Guides: Common Development Tasks (Numbered Level 2
            Headings and Below):**
                * 9. Setting Up User Authentication:
                    * 9.1.  Adding User Registration: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
                    * 9.2.  Implementing User Login Functionality: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
                    * 9.3.  Creating Basic User Profiles: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
                * 10.  Building the Teams Feature (Including Nested Teams):

                    * 11.1.  Adding Login and Registration Links to `welcome.blade.php`: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide

            **Key Formatting and Technology Requirements (Keep it Consistent and
            Clear):**


            * **Markdown Output:**  Generate a valid Markdown file (e.g.,
            `docs/getting_started_novices.md`).

            * **Numbered Headings (Mostly):** Use numbered headings for sections
            within "Understanding the Codebase" and "Step-by-Step Guides" for
            clear structure. "Welcome" is unnumbered for a friendlier opening.

            * **Code Blocks with Language:**  Always use code blocks (code
            fences) and *explicitly state the language* (e.g., ```php, ```html,
            ```javascript, ```mermaid) for all code and diagrams.  This is
            crucial for readability.

            * **Mermaid Diagrams: Visual Aids for Beginners:** *Actively and
            thoughtfully use Mermaid diagrams* to visually explain complex
            concepts like database relationships, routing flows, and application
            architecture.  Ensure diagrams are simple, well-labeled, and
            directly support the text – *diagrams are for clarity, not
            decoration*.


            **Crucially Important: Reasoning and Justification for Novices:**
            For *every section, every step, every code example, and every design
            choice*, *briefly explain the *why***.  Why is this code written
            this way? Why is this step necessary?  How does this benefit the
            application *and* make it easier to work with?  **Focus on
            explaining the *reasoning* from a beginner's perspective.**


            **Tone and Voice: Patient, Encouraging, and Beginner-Focused:**
            Write in a patient, clear, concise, and *above all, encouraging*
            tone.  Imagine you are mentoring a junior developer.  Use analogies,
            avoid jargon, and celebrate small wins.  Make the documentation a
            *positive learning experience*.


            **Think Like a Novice Developer Advocate:**  Throughout the writing
            process, constantly ask yourself: "Would a novice developer
            understand this? Is this clear enough? Is this helpful? What would
            *they* need to know next?"  Your goal is to make this documentation
            the *absolute best resource* for a novice developer joining this
            Laravel 12 project.


            Let's create **truly exceptional and empowering documentation for
            our novice developers!**

            the best option<<<

            Imagine you are creating documentation specifically for **novice
            developers** who are just starting to work with a Laravel 12
            application at `@codebase`.  Your goal is to produce a Markdown
            document that will be their friendly guide to understanding and
            contributing to this project.  This document should be:


            * **Comprehensive (but not overwhelming):**  Cover the essential
            parts of the application that a new developer needs to know,
            focusing on the most important concepts first.

            * **Detailed (but easy to follow):** Provide enough depth to
            understand, but explain things in a step-by-step, beginner-friendly
            way, avoiding jargon where possible.

            * **Practical (hands-on guidance):**  Offer clear, step-by-step
            instructions for common development tasks they will likely
            encounter.

            * **Easy to Navigate (well-organized):**  Be structured logically
            with clear headings so they can quickly find the information they
            need.


            **Document Outline:**


            1. **Welcome to the Application! (Unnumbered Level 1 Heading):**
                * Start with a friendly, non-technical introduction to the application. What does it do? What problem does it solve?
                * Briefly explain the purpose of this documentation and how it will help them.
                * Use a simple Mermaid diagram (if possible) to give a very high-level overview of the application's main parts (like "Users," "Teams," "Content" -  keep it conceptual).

            2. **Getting Started with the Codebase (Numbered Level 2 Headings
            and Below):**
                * 1. Project Structure: Explain how the project files and folders are organized in a way that's easy for someone new to understand. Highlight the key directories like `app`, `routes`, `resources`, `database`.
                * 2. Understanding the Database (Data Model): Explain the basics of the database. What are the main tables (like `users`, `teams`) and how are they related? A simple Mermaid diagram showing key tables and relationships would be very helpful.
                * 3. How Requests Work (Routing): Explain in simple terms how URLs in the browser get directed to different parts of the application. A very basic Mermaid diagram of the routing flow could be useful.
                * 4. Controllers: Explain what controllers do in a beginner-friendly way (like "the traffic cops of the application"). Give examples of key controllers and their jobs.
                * 5. Models: Explain what models represent (like "blueprints for database tables"). Describe important models and what data they handle.
                * 6. Views: Explain how views are used to display information to the user. Introduce Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro as the tools used for creating views in this project, but keep it high-level for now.
                * 7. Key Services (if any): If there are important service classes, explain what they do in plain language.
                * 8. Tools We Use (Technology Stack): Briefly list the main technologies used (Laravel, Volt, Flux/Flux-Pro, Folio) and *especially emphasize the use of Laravel's built-in features and first-party packages whenever possible*.

            3. **Step-by-Step Guides: Building Common Features (Numbered Level 2
            Headings and Below):**
                * 9.  Adding User Login and Registration:
                    * 9.1. Setting up User Registration (Detailed, beginner-friendly steps)
                    * 9.2. Implementing User Login (Detailed, beginner-friendly steps)
                    * 9.3. Creating User Profiles (Detailed, beginner-friendly steps)
                * 10. Creating Teams (with Nested Teams):
                    * 10.1. Building the Teams Feature (Detailed, beginner-friendly steps for nested teams)
                * 11. Adding Navigation to the Welcome Page:
                    * 11.1.  Making the Welcome Page User-Friendly (Simple steps to add login/registration links to `welcome.blade.php`)

            **Important Formatting and Technology Rules:**


            * **Markdown Format:**  Save the document as a standard Markdown
            file (e.g., `docs/getting_started.md`).

            * **Numbered Headings (mostly):** Use numbered headings (starting
            from level 2) for sections within "Getting Started with the
            Codebase" and "Step-by-Step Guides."  The "Welcome" section is
            unnumbered to feel more like an introduction.

            * **Code Blocks with Language:**  Always use code blocks (code
            fences) for code examples and clearly specify the language (e.g.,
            ```php,```html, ```javascript).

            * **Visual Aids (Mermaid Diagrams):**  Use simple Mermaid diagrams
            to illustrate things like database relationships, routing flow, or
            high-level application structure.  Keep diagrams easy to understand
            for beginners.

            * **Volt Views for New Pages:** Any new views you create must be
            Volt functional components.

            * **Flux/Flux-Pro Components for Views:**  For building the user
            interface in new views, use only Flux and Flux-Pro components.

            * **Folio for Routing:**  All routing must be done using Folio
            page-based routing, placing:
              * Guest pages in `resources/views/pages/guest/`
              * Logged-in user pages in `resources/views/pages/resident/`
            * **Prioritize Laravel First-Party Features:** *Whenever possible*,
            use Laravel's built-in features and official first-party packages
            for implementing functionality. This is especially important for
            novice developers as it aligns with standard Laravel practices and
            easier to maintain.


            **Explain Your Thinking (Reasoning):**  Throughout the
            documentation, briefly explain *why* you are doing things a certain
            way or why a particular approach is recommended. This helps novice
            developers learn the "why" behind the code, not just the "how."


            **Write in a Friendly and Encouraging Tone:** Remember you are
            writing for beginners. Use clear, simple language, avoid technical
            jargon where possible, and be encouraging!  Imagine you are a
            friendly senior developer helping a junior developer get started.


            3. **Implementation Guides (Numbered Level 2 Headings and Below):**
                * 9. User Authentication and Profiles:
                    * 9.1. User Registration (**Step-by-step instructions for a novice developer**)
                    * 9.2. User Login (**Step-by-step instructions for a novice developer**)
                    * 9.3. User Profiles (**Step-by-step instructions for a novice developer**)
                * 10. Teams Feature:
                    * 10.1. Implementing Nested Teams (**Step-by-step instructions for a novice developer**)
                * 11. Modifying Welcome View:
                    * 11.1. Adding Navigation Links (**Step-by-step instructions for a novice developer**)

            **Your Mission: Become the Ultimate Guide for Novice Developers
            Joining Our Laravel 12 Project!**


            Imagine you are a friendly and experienced senior developer tasked
            with creating the *perfect* onboarding documentation for **novice
            developers** who are brand new to our Laravel 12 application at
            `@codebase`.  Your goal is to craft a Markdown document that is not
            just documentation, but a welcoming and empowering guide that
            transforms them from newcomers to confident contributors.


            **Your Core Objective:**  Produce a Markdown document that acts as a
            **highly effective and encouraging learning resource specifically
            for novice developers.**  This means your documentation MUST be:


            * **Crystal Clear and Jargon-Free:**  Use simple, everyday
            language.  Avoid all technical jargon unless absolutely necessary,
            and if you must use it, explain it thoroughly with analogies and
            real-world examples. Imagine explaining coding concepts to someone
            completely new to programming.

            * **Actionable and Step-by-Step:**  Provide very detailed,
            step-by-step instructions for every task.  Assume *zero* prior
            knowledge of the application or even specific Laravel
            features.  Think "paint-by-numbers" instructions for common
            development tasks.

            * **Deeply Explanatory (but Patiently Paced):**  Go beyond just
            "what" to do, explain the "why" behind every step and concept.  But
            deliver information in manageable chunks.  Prioritize essential
            information and avoid overwhelming beginners with too much detail at
            once.

            * **Perfectly Organized and Easy to Navigate:** Structure the
            document with logical sections, clear and descriptive headings, and
            subheadings.  Use formatting (bold text, bullet points, code blocks)
            to make it scannable and easy to find specific information
            *instantly*. Think of it as a well-organized textbook for beginners.

            * **Warm, Encouraging, and Mentor-Like Tone:** Write in a friendly,
            patient, and enthusiastic tone.  Imagine you are sitting
            side-by-side with a junior developer, guiding them through the
            codebase.  Offer encouragement and positive reinforcement throughout
            the documentation.


            **Document Outline: Your Beginner's Journey Through the Codebase**


            1. **Welcome to the Team! (Unnumbered Level 1 Heading):**
                * Start with a genuinely warm and welcoming message.  Make the novice developer feel immediately comfortable and valued.
                * Explain the *application's purpose* in the simplest terms possible.  What real-world problem does it solve? Use an analogy if it helps (e.g., "It's like a digital library for managing [type of data]").
                * Clearly state the *purpose of this documentation*:  "This guide is designed to help you, a new developer, quickly understand our application and start contributing confidently."
                * Include a **very simple, conceptual Mermaid diagram** that acts as a "map" of the application's main areas.  Use labels that are easily understood by anyone (e.g., "Users," "Content," "Settings," "Teams").  Keep it visually inviting and non-technical.

            2. **Your First Steps in the Codebase: A Guided Tour (Numbered Level
            2 Headings and Below):**
                * 1. Exploring the Project Folders: Your Codebase Map: Explain the project structure as a guided tour.  Use descriptive and encouraging headings like: "1.1. The `app` Folder: Where the Heart of Our Application Beats," "1.2. The `routes` Folder: How We Direct Traffic in Our App," "1.3. The `resources` Folder: Where We Design the User Interface."  Explain *what kind of code* and files are found in each key directory in plain English.
                * 2.  Understanding the Database: Where Our Application Stores Information: Explain the concept of a database in a very beginner-friendly way.  Use analogies (e.g., "like a well-organized filing cabinet"). Explain the main database tables (e.g., `users`, `teams`, `posts`) and their relationships.  Include a **clear and labeled Mermaid diagram to visualize the database schema**, focusing on the key tables and relationships that a beginner needs to grasp initially.  Explain the *business meaning* behind each table in simple terms.
                * 3.  How User Requests Travel Through Our Application: Routing Explained Simply:  Explain routing using a simple analogy (e.g., "like a postal service for web requests").  Explain how URLs in the browser are connected to different parts of the application.  Include a **basic Mermaid diagram illustrating a typical user request flow**, focusing on a common action like logging in or viewing a page. Keep the diagram very straightforward and easy to follow visually.
                * 4.  Controllers: The Application's Action Centers: Explain controllers using an easy-to-understand analogy (e.g., "like event organizers," "like chefs in a kitchen"). Describe the *role* of key controllers in handling user actions and requests in a non-technical way. Give concrete examples of what controllers do in the application.
                * 5.  Models: Representing Our Data in Code: Explain models as representations of database tables in the code.  Use analogies (e.g., "like blueprints for database records"). Describe important models and their key attributes using simple, business-related terms (e.g., instead of "database columns," say "pieces of information we store about each user, like their 'name' and 'email'").
                * 6.  Views: Building What Users See with Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro: Explain views as the parts of the application that users interact with. Introduce Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro as the tools we use to create these interactive user interfaces, emphasizing the *benefits for beginners* (e.g., "makes it easier to build and organize our user interface," "helps us create reusable components"). Keep the explanation high-level and focused on the advantages for developers.
                * 7.  Services: Organizing Complex Tasks Behind the Scenes (If Applicable): If service classes are used, explain their purpose as a way to keep complex logic organized and reusable.  Use a relatable analogy (e.g., "like specialized departments within a company that handle specific tasks").  Explain *why* using services is helpful for keeping the codebase clean and maintainable, especially for beginners.
                * 8.  Key Tools and Technologies: Your Developer Toolkit: Briefly list the main technologies used (Laravel 12, Volt, Flux/Flux-Pro, Folio) and *strongly emphasize the importance of using Laravel's built-in features and official first-party packages whenever possible*. Explain *why* prioritizing these is beneficial for beginners (e.g., "easier to learn," "better community support," "follows Laravel best practices").

            3. **Hands-On Guides: Building Your First Features Step-by-Step
            (Numbered Level 2 Headings and Below):**

            **Essential Formatting and Technology Guidelines (For Consistency
            and Clarity):**


            * **Markdown Output:**  Save the document as a standard Markdown
            file (e.g., `docs/novice_developer_guide.md`).

            * **Numbered Headings (Primarily):** Use numbered headings for
            sections within "Your First Steps in the Codebase" and "Hands-On
            Guides" to create a clear, step-by-step structure. "Welcome to the
            Team!" should remain unnumbered for a more inviting introduction.

            * **Code Blocks with Language Labels:**  Always use code blocks
            (code fences) for all code examples and diagrams, and *explicitly
            label the language* (e.g., ```php, ```html, ```javascript,
            ```mermaid). This is crucial for readability and for beginners to
            understand the code context.

            * **Mermaid Diagrams: Your Visual Explanations:** *Actively and
            strategically use Mermaid diagrams* as visual aids to explain
            complex concepts.  Ensure diagrams are:
                * **Simple and Uncluttered:**  Focus on the essential elements.
                * **Clearly Labeled:** Use descriptive labels that beginners can understand.
                * **Directly Relevant to the Text:**  Each diagram should immediately enhance the understanding of the surrounding text.
                * **Used Thoughtfully, Not Just Decoratively:** Diagrams should have a clear pedagogical purpose.

            **Critical: Explain the "Why" and the "How" - Always from a Novice
            Perspective:** For *every section, subsection, step in a guide, code
            example, and design choice*:


            * **Explain the *Reasoning* (the "Why"):**  Why is this done this
            way? What problem does it solve? What are the benefits, *especially
            for a beginner*?  Use analogies and simple explanations.

            * **Explain the *Implementation* (the "How"):** Provide clear,
            step-by-step instructions. Break down complex tasks into smaller,
            manageable steps. Use code examples to illustrate concepts.

            * **Focus on Beginner Benefits:**  Always frame explanations in
            terms of how this knowledge or skill will help a novice developer
            become more effective and confident in working with the codebase.


            **Tone and Voice: Your Persona as a Friendly Mentor:**  Write in a
            consistently warm, patient, encouraging, and *mentor-like*
            tone.  Imagine you are personally guiding a junior developer.  Use
            phrases that build confidence, offer support, and celebrate
            progress.  Make the documentation a *positive and empowering
            learning experience*.  Examples of tone: "Great job!", "You're doing
            fantastic!", "Don't worry, this is a common point of confusion,
            let's break it down...", "Think of it this way...".


            **Final Thought:  Test Your Documentation Through Novice
            Eyes:**  Before considering the documentation complete, mentally
            review it from the perspective of a *complete beginner*.  Ask
            yourself: "Is this *truly* clear? Is it *genuinely* helpful? Would
            *I* feel confident after reading this as a novice developer?"  Your
            goal is to create documentation that is not just informative, but
            truly *empowering* for novice developers.


            Let's create **the most outstanding and beginner-friendly
            documentation imaginable!  Documentation that will make our novice
            developers feel welcomed, supported, and ready to build amazing
            things!**

            ```


            **Key Improvements in this Best Option (compared to the previous
            "Best Option"):**


            * **Stronger Persona and Mission:**  The prompt starts with a more
            defined "mission" and persona of a "friendly senior developer,"
            setting the tone and purpose immediately.

            * **Emphasis on "Ultimate Guide" and "Perfect Onboarding":**  Sets a
            high bar for the quality of the documentation and emphasizes its
            role in onboarding.

            * **"Core Objective" - More Direct and Focused:**  Clearly states
            the core objective is to be a "highly effective and encouraging
            learning resource."

            * **Even Stronger Emphasis on Clarity and Jargon-Free
            Language:**  Reiterates the need for simple language and analogies,
            even more explicitly.

            * **"Paint-by-Numbers" Instructions:**  Uses the analogy of
            "paint-by-numbers" to emphasize the level of detail required in
            step-by-step guides.

            * **"Perfectly Organized Textbook" Analogy:**  Compares the desired
            document structure to a "well-organized textbook" for beginners.

            * **Headings as Guided Tour/Journey:**  Headings in the "Document
            Outline" are rephrased to be more descriptive and encouraging,
            framing the documentation as a "journey" for the novice developer.

            * **More Concrete Examples in Headings:**  Provides examples of
            descriptive headings for project structure (e.g., "The `app` Folder:
            Where the Heart of Our Application Beats").

            * **Emphasis on Business Meaning of Data:**  Specifically asks to
            explain the "business meaning" behind database tables, connecting
            technical concepts to real-world understanding.

            * **"Your Developer Toolkit" Heading:**  Uses a more encouraging
            heading for the technology stack section.

            * **"Your First Feature Implementation" and "Your First UI
            Customization" Headings:**  Frames the step-by-step guides as
            opportunities for early success and accomplishment.

            * **"Your Visual Explanations" Heading for Diagrams:**  Highlights
            the purpose of diagrams as visual aids for explanation.

            * **"Test Your Documentation Through Novice Eyes" - Self-Review:**
            Adds a crucial step of self-reviewing the documentation from a
            novice developer's perspective to ensure its effectiveness.

            * **More Frequent and Stronger Encouragement:**  The tone throughout
            the prompt is even more encouraging and mentor-like, using phrases
            like "Welcome to the Team!", "Your Beginner's Journey," "Your
            Developer Toolkit," and ending with a very enthusiastic closing.


            This further improved prompt is designed to elicit documentation
            that is not only technically sound and beginner-friendly but also
            emotionally supportive and genuinely empowering for novice
            developers, making their entry into the Laravel 12 project as
            positive and successful as possible.

            **Your Mission: Create Exceptionally Helpful Documentation for
            Novice Developers**


            Imagine you are the lead documentation writer for a Laravel 12
            application located at `@codebase`.  Your *sole focus* is to create
            a Markdown document that will empower **novice developers** – those
            who are new to Laravel and potentially new to professional
            development – to confidently understand, navigate, and contribute to
            this codebase.


            **Your Goal:** Produce a Markdown document that is **specifically
            designed for novice developers** and excels in these key areas:


            * **Clarity Above All Else:**  Explanations must be crystal clear,
            using simple language and avoiding technical jargon as much as
            possible.  Think of explaining complex ideas with analogies and
            real-world examples.

            * **Step-by-Step Guidance:**  Provide practical, actionable,
            step-by-step guides for common tasks a new developer will
            face.  Don't assume prior knowledge – walk them through each step.

            * **Deep but Gentle Detail:** Offer sufficient depth to understand
            the 'why' behind the code, but present it in digestible chunks,
            avoiding information overload.  Prioritize the most essential
            information first.

            * **Effortless Navigation:** Structure the document logically with
            clear, descriptive headings and subheadings.  Use formatting
            (bolding, lists, code blocks) to enhance readability and make it
            easy to find specific information quickly.

            * **Encouraging and Patient Tone:**  Adopt a patient, supportive,
            and encouraging tone.  Remember these are novice developers; your
            documentation should be a welcoming and confidence-building
            resource.


            **Document Outline:**


            1. **Welcome, New Developer! (Unnumbered Level 1 Heading):**
                * Start with a warm, welcoming introduction to the application.  Imagine you are personally greeting a new team member.
                * Briefly explain the *purpose* of the application in simple, non-technical terms. What problem does it solve in the real world?
                * Clearly state the *goal* of this documentation: to help novice developers get up to speed quickly and confidently.
                * Use a *very simple* Mermaid diagram to provide a high-level, conceptual overview of the application's main areas (e.g., "Users," "Data," "Content Management"). Keep it visual and non-intimidating.

            2. **Understanding the Codebase: A Beginner's Guide (Numbered Level
            2 Headings and Below):**
                * 1. Project Files and Folders:  Explain the project structure like a guided tour.  Describe the *purpose* of key directories (e.g., `app`, `routes`, `resources`, `database`) in plain language.  What kind of code lives in each folder?
                * 2. Working with Data: The Database Explained:  Introduce the database in a beginner-friendly way.  What is a database? Why do we need one? Explain the main database tables (like `users`, `teams`, etc.) and their relationships using a **Mermaid diagram to visualize the database schema clearly**. Focus on the *business meaning* of the data.
                * 3. How the Application Listens and Responds: Routing Basics:  Explain routing in simple terms. How do URLs in the browser lead to different parts of the application? Use a **Mermaid diagram to illustrate a *typical* user journey/routing flow**, keeping it straightforward.
                * 4. Controllers: The Application's Decision Makers: Explain what controllers *do* using an analogy (e.g., "traffic controllers," "orchestrators").  Describe the *role* of key controllers in handling user requests and actions.
                * 5. Models: Representing Data in Code:  Explain models as representations of database tables in code.  Describe important models and their attributes in terms that a beginner can grasp.
                * 6. Views: Building the User Interface with Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro: Introduce Views as what users see. Explain how Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro are used to build interactive components, emphasizing the *benefits* of component-based UI for maintainability and organization (without getting too technical).
                * 7. Services: Organizing Complex Logic (If Applicable): If services are used, explain their purpose as a way to organize and reuse complex parts of the application's logic, using a simple analogy if possible.
                * 8. External Tools: Key Packages We Use: List and *briefly explain* the most important third-party packages. Focus on *why* these packages were chosen and what problem they solve for the application in a practical sense.

            3. **Step-by-Step Guides: Common Development Tasks (Numbered Level 2
            Headings and Below):**
                * 9. Setting Up User Authentication:
                    * 9.1.  Adding User Registration: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
                    * 9.2.  Implementing User Login Functionality: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
                    * 9.3.  Creating Basic User Profiles: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
                * 10. Building the Teams Feature (Including Nested Teams):
                    * 10.1.  Implementing Teams: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners (covering nested teams)
                * 11. Customizing the Welcome Page Navigation:
                    * 11.1.  Adding Login and Registration Links to `welcome.blade.php`: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide

            **Key Formatting and Technology Requirements (Keep it Consistent and
            Clear):**


            * **Markdown Output:**  Generate a valid Markdown file (e.g.,
            `docs/getting_started_novices.md`).

            * **Numbered Headings (Mostly):** Use numbered headings for sections
            within "Understanding the Codebase" and "Step-by-Step Guides" for
            clear structure. "Welcome" is unnumbered for a friendlier opening.

            * **Code Blocks with Language:**  Always use code blocks (code
            fences) and *explicitly state the language* (e.g., ```php,```html,
            ```javascript,```mermaid) for all code and diagrams.  This is
            crucial for readability.

            * **Mermaid Diagrams: Visual Aids for Beginners:** *Actively and
            thoughtfully use Mermaid diagrams* to visually explain complex
            concepts like database relationships, routing flows, and application
            architecture.  Ensure diagrams are simple, well-labeled, and
            directly support the text – *diagrams are for clarity, not
            decoration*.


            **Crucially Important: Reasoning and Justification for Novices:**
            For *every section, every step, every code example, and every design
            choice*, *briefly explain the *why***.  Why is this code written
            this way? Why is this step necessary?  How does this benefit the
            application *and* make it easier to work with?  **Focus on
            explaining the *reasoning* from a beginner's perspective.**


            **Tone and Voice: Patient, Encouraging, and Beginner-Focused:**
            Write in a patient, clear, concise, and *above all, encouraging*
            tone.  Imagine you are mentoring a junior developer.  Use analogies,
            avoid jargon, and celebrate small wins.  Make the documentation a
            *positive learning experience*.


            **Think Like a Novice Developer Advocate:**  Throughout the writing
            process, constantly ask yourself: "Would a novice developer
            understand this? Is this clear enough? Is this helpful? What would
            *they* need to know next?"  Your goal is to make this documentation
            the *absolute best resource* for a novice developer joining this
            Laravel 12 project.

            ```prompt

            **YOUR ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY: Create Jaw-Droppingly Helpful
            Documentation for Novice Developers!**


            Imagine you are the *ultimate mentor* documentation writer for our
            Laravel 12 application at `@codebase`.  Your *ONLY* mission is to
            craft a Markdown document that will utterly *delight* and *empower*
            **novice developers** – those who are genuinely new to Laravel and
            possibly to coding itself – to not just understand, but to *master*
            our codebase and become confident, contributing team members.


            **Your Unwavering Standard of Success:** Produce a Markdown document
            that is so exceptionally well-crafted *for novice developers* that
            it becomes the gold standard for beginner-friendly technical
            documentation.  This means your documentation MUST achieve absolute
            excellence in:


            * **Unrivaled Clarity – Speak Their Language:**  Explanations must
            be so crystal clear that a bright person with *no prior coding
            experience* could grasp the core concepts.  Use everyday language,
            vivid analogies (think children's books, not textbooks), and
            completely banish technical jargon unless absolutely essential *and
            meticulously explained*.  Imagine you are explaining code to a
            friend who is *completely new to tech*.

            * **Hyper-Detailed, Step-by-Step, Click-by-Click
            Guidance:**  Provide instructions that are so granular and
            step-by-step that a novice developer can follow them with *absolute
            certainty* and *zero guesswork*.  Think of it as providing
            "IKEA-style" instructions for coding tasks.  For every step, ask
            yourself: "Could someone with no prior experience do this
            *flawlessly*?".

            * **"Gentle Descent" into Deep Understanding – Layered
            Learning:**  Offer depth and insight into the "why" behind the code,
            but present information in small, easily digestible layers.  Start
            with the absolute essentials and gradually introduce more detail as
            they progress.  Avoid overwhelming beginners with walls of text or
            too much information at once. Prioritize the *most crucial*
            information for getting started *immediately*.

            * **Effortless, Intuitive Navigation – A Map for the
            Perplexed:**  Structure the document with laser-like logical
            precision, using headings and subheadings that are so clear and
            descriptive that a novice developer can find exactly what they need
            in *seconds*, even if they don't know the technical terms yet.  Use
            formatting (bold, lists, code blocks, callouts) to create a visually
            scannable and inviting document.  Imagine it as a perfectly indexed
            and cross-referenced beginner's guide.

            * **Radiate Encouragement and Patience – Your Mentor's
            Voice:**  Write in a tone that is consistently warm, patient,
            enthusiastic, and *deeply encouraging*.  Imagine you are a
            supportive and endlessly patient mentor sitting beside a junior
            developer, celebrating every small success and gently guiding them
            through challenges.  Infuse your documentation with phrases that
            build confidence and create a positive, empowering learning
            experience (e.g., "You've got this!", "Fantastic work!", "Let's
            tackle this together!", "This might seem tricky at first, but we'll
            break it down...").


            **Document Blueprint:  Your Novice Developer's Path to Mastery**


            1. **🚀 Welcome to the Adventure! (Unnumbered Level 1 Heading):**
                * Begin with an *over-the-top* welcoming message that conveys genuine excitement and support.  Think of it as a personal, enthusiastic greeting from the entire development team.  Make them feel instantly valued and excited to learn.
                * Explain the *application's purpose* in the *absolute simplest* terms imaginable.  Use a real-world analogy that *anyone* can understand, even someone outside of tech (e.g., "Our application is like a super-organized online notebook for [specific user group] to [achieve specific goal]").
                * Explicitly state the *life-changing goal* of this documentation: "This guide is your personal roadmap to becoming a confident Laravel developer on our project. We're here to help you every step of the way!"
                * Include an **ultra-simple, visually appealing Mermaid diagram** that acts as a "treasure map" of the application.  Use only 3-5 *highly intuitive* labels (e.g., "Users Login Here," "See the Data," "Manage Content," "Teams Work Together"). Use bright colors and playful icons if possible to make it visually inviting and utterly non-intimidating.

            2. **🗺️ Your First Expedition into the Codebase: A Guided,
            Hand-Holding Tour (Numbered Level 2 Headings and Below):**
                * 1. 📂 Exploring the Project Folders: Unlocking the Secrets of Our Code Map:  Explain the project structure as an exciting exploration. Use headings like: "2.1. 📂 The `app` Folder: The Control Center of Our Application (Think of it like the 'brain'!)," "2.2. 🚦 The `routes` Folder:  Directing Web Traffic Like a Pro (Imagine it as the 'street signs' of our app!)," "2.3. 🎨 The `resources` Folder:  Designing the Look and Feel (This is where we make it beautiful!)." For *each* key directory, explain *in one sentence* what it's for and give *concrete examples* of file names you'd find inside (e.g., "In `app/Http/Controllers`, you'll find files like `UserController.php` – these are the 'action takers' of our app!").
                * 2. 🗄️ Understanding the Database: Our Application's Super-Organized Storage Room: Explain the database using a *highly relatable analogy* (e.g., "Imagine a giant, perfectly organized filing cabinet where we store all our application's information").  Explain *what* a database is and *why* it's essential.  Explain the main database tables (e.g., `users`, `teams`, `articles`) using *real-world examples* of what each table represents (e.g., "The `users` table stores information about each person who uses our app, like their name, email, and password"). Include a **crystal-clear, beautifully designed Mermaid diagram to visualize the database schema**, focusing on just the 3-4 *most important* tables and their *most obvious* relationships.  Explain the *real-world business meaning* of each table and relationship in simple, non-technical terms.
                * 3. 🌐 How User Actions Travel Through Our Application:  The Magic of Web Requests Explained: Explain routing using a *captivating analogy* (e.g., "Imagine our application is like a city, and routing is like the roads and traffic lights that guide user actions to the right place").  Explain how URLs in the browser trigger actions in the application.  Include a **super-simple, visually engaging Mermaid diagram illustrating a *single, very common* user journey**, like "User visits the homepage" or "User logs in."  Keep the diagram *extremely* minimal and focus on the *flow* of the request.
                * 4. 🕹️ Controllers: The Masterminds Behind the Actions: Explain controllers using a fun analogy (e.g., "Controllers are like the 'game masters' of our application – they decide what happens when a user does something!"). Describe the *role* of key controllers in handling user requests and actions in a *completely non-technical way*. Give *specific, relatable examples* of what controllers do in the application (e.g., "The `UserController` is in charge of everything related to users, like creating new accounts or updating profiles.").
                * 5. 🧱 Models:  Building Blocks of Our Data: Explain models as simple, understandable representations of database tables in code. Use analogies (e.g., "Models are like the 'LEGO bricks' of our application's data – we use them to build and manage information"). Describe *key* models and their *most important* attributes using *everyday language* (e.g., for the `User` model, say "It has attributes like 'name', 'email', and 'password' – these are the pieces of information we store for each user.").
                * 6. 🖼️ Views:  Creating the Beautiful User Interface with Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro: Explain views as *what users actually see and interact with*. Introduce Volt and Flux/Flux-Pro as *amazing tools* for building user interfaces, emphasizing the *beginner-friendly benefits* (e.g., "Volt makes our views super-fast and organized," "Flux/Flux-Pro gives us pre-built 'building blocks' to create beautiful interfaces easily!"). Keep the explanation focused on the *positive impact* for developers, especially beginners.
                * 7. ⚙️ Services:  Organizing Complex Tasks Behind the Scenes Like a Pro (If Applicable): If service classes are used, explain their purpose as a way to keep the codebase clean and organized by handling complex logic in separate, reusable units.
