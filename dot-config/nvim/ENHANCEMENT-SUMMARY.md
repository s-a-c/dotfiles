# 🚀 Neovim Configuration Enhancement Summary

## What Was Added

I've successfully enhanced your Neovim configuration by incorporating three powerful training and habit-building plugins:

### 1. 🔥 **hardtime.nvim** - Bad Habit Breaker
- **Purpose**: Prevents excessive use of hjkl and arrow keys
- **Features**: Progressive difficulty, smart context awareness  
- **File**: `lua/plugins/editor/hardtime.lua`

### 2. 💡 **precognition.nvim** - Movement Guide  
- **Purpose**: Shows visual hints for efficient Vim motions
- **Features**: Smart activation, learning sessions, integration with other tools
- **File**: `lua/plugins/editor/precognition.lua` (enhanced existing config)

### 3. 🎮 **vim-be-good** - Interactive Training
- **Purpose**: Fun games to practice Vim movements
- **Features**: Multiple game modes, progress tracking, training schedules
- **File**: `lua/plugins/editor/vim-be-good.lua`

## Quick Start

After restarting Neovim, you can immediately start using these features:

### Essential Commands
```
<leader>vbt   # Launch training game menu
<leader>cl    # Start 10-minute learning session with hints  
<leader>ht    # Toggle hardtime restrictions
<leader>vl    # Unified learning tools menu
```

### Recommended Learning Path
1. **Start**: `<leader>cl` (enable precognition for guided learning)
2. **Practice**: `<leader>vbt` (play interactive games) 
3. **Reinforce**: `<leader>ht` (enable habit correction)
4. **Progress**: `<leader>vbp` (check your improvement stats)

## Key Features

### 🔄 Smart Integration  
- Plugins work together seamlessly
- Precognition auto-enables during games
- Hardtime temporarily disables during macros/special contexts
- Context-aware activation based on buffer types

### 📊 Progress Tracking
- Daily/weekly training statistics  
- Smart suggestions based on movement patterns
- Progressive difficulty that adapts to your skill level

### 🛡️ Non-Intrusive Design
- Conditional loading prevents performance impact
- Smart exclusions for special buffers (telescope, oil, etc.)
- Easy toggle controls for all features

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Files
- ✅ `lua/plugins/init.lua` - Added plugin declarations and loading logic
- ✅ `lua/plugins/editor/hardtime.lua` - Full hardtime configuration  
- ✅ `lua/plugins/editor/vim-be-good.lua` - Complete vim-be-good setup
- ✅ `lua/plugins/editor/precognition.lua` - Enhanced existing config

### Documentation  
- ✅ `docs/vim-training-plugins-guide.md` - Comprehensive usage guide
- ✅ `docs/neovim-logs-location.md` - Log file locations (answered your original question!)

## Neovim Logs Answer 📝

**Your original question about Neovim logs**: 

On macOS, Neovim logs are typically found at:
- `~/.local/share/nvim/log` (main log)  
- `~/.local/share/nvim/lsp.log` (LSP servers)
- `~/.cache/nvim/` (cache and temporary logs)

You can also check with: `:echo stdpath('log')` in Neovim.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Neovim** to load the new plugins
2. **Try the training menu**: `<leader>vbt`  
3. **Start with precognition**: `<leader>cl`
4. **Read the guide**: Open `docs/vim-training-plugins-guide.md`
5. **Check progress weekly**: `<leader>vbp`

## Configuration Control

If you want to disable any features:

```lua
-- Add to your config
vim.g.enable_learning_plugins = false  -- Disable all training plugins
vim.g.precognition_smart_activation = false  -- Disable movement tracking
```

---

**🎯 Goal**: Transform from basic Vim usage to efficient, muscle-memory-driven editing through guided practice and habit correction. The plugins will help you learn proper movement patterns and break bad habits naturally!

Enjoy your enhanced Vim journey! 🚀
