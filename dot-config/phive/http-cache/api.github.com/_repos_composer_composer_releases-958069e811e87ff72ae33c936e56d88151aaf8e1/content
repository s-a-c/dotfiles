problems\r\n\r\n- If you see errors with missing commands (`symfony-cmd: command not found`) or other failures and you are relying on plugins and running Composer as root (for example when you use **AWS ElasticBeanstalk**), read https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11839\r\n- If you are using plugins and bitbucket pipelines, read https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11839\r\n- If you see `Fatal error: Declaration of {some-class}::execute(...) must be compatible with Composer\\Command\\SomeCommand::execute(): int` then whatever code is extending a Composer command needs to be updated to also add the int return type, see https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11843 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Complete Changelog\r\n\r\n  * Security: Fixed code execution and possible privilege escalation via compromised vendor dir contents (GHSA-7c6p-848j-wh5h / CVE-2024-24821)\r\n  * Changed the default of the `audit.abandoned` config setting to `fail`, set it to `report` or `ignore` if you do not want this, or set it via `COMPOSER_AUDIT_ABANDONED` env var (#11643)\r\n  * Added --minimal-changes (-m) flag to `update`/`require`/`remove` commands to perform partial update with --with-dependencies while changing only what is absolutely necessary in transitive dependencies (#11665)\r\n  * Added --sort-by-age (-A) flag to `outdated`/`show` commands to allow sorting by and displaying the release date (most outdated first) (#11762)\r\n  * Added support for `--self` combined with `--installed` or `--locked` in `show` command, to add the root package to the package list being output (#11785)\r\n  * Added severity information to `audit` command output (#11702)\r\n  * Added `scripts-aliases` top level key in composer.json to define aliases for custom scripts you defined (#11666)\r\n  * Added IPv4 fallback on connection timeout, as well as a `COMPOSER_IPRESOLVE` env var to force IPv4 or IPv6, set it to `4` or `6` (#11791)\r\n  * Added support for wildcards in `outdated`'s --ignore arg (#11831)\r\n  * Added support for `bump` command bumping `*` to `>=current version` (#11694)\r\n  * Added detection of constraints that cannot possibly match anything to `validate` command (#11829)\r\n  * Added package source information to the output of `install` when running in very verbose (-vv) mode (#11763)\r\n  * Added audit of Composer's own bundled dependencies in `diagnose` command (#11761)\r\n  * Added GitHub token expiration date to `diagnose` command output (#11688)\r\n  * Added non-zero status code to why/why-not commands (#11796)\r\n  *

Read the [Composer 2.3 Release Announcement](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-3/) for more details on the release highlights.\r\n\r\n### Complete Changelog\r\n\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum PHP version is now 7.2.5+, use the [Composer 2.2 LTS](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/10340) if you are stuck with an older PHP (#10343)\r\n  * BC Break: added native parameter & return types to many internal APIs, we explicitly left the most extended/implemented symbols untouched but if this causes problems nonetheless please report it ASAP (#10547, #10561)\r\n  * BC Break: added visibility to all constants, a few internal ones have been made private/protected, if this causes problems please report it ASAP (#10550)\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum supported Symfony components version is now 5.4, this only affects you if you are requiring composer/composer directly however, which is generally frowned upon\r\n  * Bumped `composer-plugin-api` to `2.3.0`\r\n  * Bumped bundled Symfony components from 2.8 to 5.4 🥳\r\n  * Added `declare(strict_types=1)` to all the classes, which for sure could cause regressions in edge cases, please report with stack traces (#10567)\r\n  * Added `--patch-only` to the `outdated` command to only show updates to patch versions and ignore new major/minor versions (#10589)\r\n  * Added clickable links to various commands for terminals which support it (#10430)\r\n  * Added ProcessExecutor ability to receive commands as arrays by (internals/plugin change only) (#10435)\r\n  * Added abandoned flag to `show`/`outdated` commands JSON-formatted output (#10485)\r\n  * Added config.reference option to `path` repositories to configure the way the reference is generated, and possibly reduce composer.lock conflicts (#10488)\r\n  * Added automatic removal of allow-plugins rules when removing a plugin via the `remove` command (#10615)\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQ & COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQS env vars to configure

2.3 is ready for a release, and we need your help to help test it and report any regression.\r\n\r\nThis release is special as it contains almost only **big internal changes** allowing us to modernize our PHP code:\r\n\r\n- **Upgraded minimum supported PHP** version from 5.3.2 to 7.2.5\r\n- **Upgraded symfony component** dependencies from 2.8.x to 5.4.x\r\n- **Added scalar parameter types** where possible, this should not break anything as [PHP 7.2 contravariance allows this](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.variance.php)\r\n- **Added return types** where possible. This will break code that extends ours and does not declare the same return types. For this reason, our most extended classes/interfaces have not been modified to retain BC: `Composer\\IO\\*`, `Composer\\Installer\\*`, `Composer\\Autoload\\ClassLoader`, `Composer\\InstalledVersions`, `Composer\\Plugin\\*`, `Composer\\Repository\\*`, `Composer\\Util\\{Filesystem,HttpDownloader,RemoteFilesystem}` and a few select others. Hopefully this avoids most breakage, but we may still see some extensions break. **If you can fix these breakages by adding return types and move on that would be the preferred way, but if they are breaking established plugins or others which cannot easily be updated everywhere they're used we will rollback those return type additions as needed.**\r\n- **Added `declare(strict_types=1)`** to all files, which is likely to break some edge case things which were not caught by the test suite.\r\n\r\nWe'd be very glad if anyone can **try it out** with their projects, and **especially for people extending Composer in some way (plugin or other)** to try it out.\r\n\r\n### Please try it out!\r\n\r\n- Running `composer self-update --preview` will get you the 2.3.0-RC1 (if you are running PHP 7.2.5 or above)\r\n- Running `composer self-update --stable` will get you back on the latest 2.2 stable release if things broke.\r\n- Report any issues you encounter as a new issue specifying you tried the 2.3 RC and please include stack traces & repro details.\r\n\r\n### Full Changelog\r\n\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum PHP version is now 7.2.5+, use the [Composer 2.2 LTS](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/10340) if you are stuck with an older PHP (#10343)\r\n  * BC Break: added native parameter & return types to many internal APIs, we explicitly left the most extended/implemented symbols untouched but if this causes problems nonetheless please report it ASAP (#10547, #10561)\r\n  * BC Break: added visibility to all constants, a few internal ones have been made private/protected, if this causes problems please report it ASAP (#10550)\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum supported Symfony components version is now 5.4, this only affects you if you are requiring composer/composer directly however, which is generally frowned upon\r\n  * Bumped `composer-plugin-api` to `2.3.0`\r\n  * Bumped bundled Symfony components from 2.8 to 5.4 🥳\r\n  * Added `declare(strict_types=1)` to all the classes, which for sure could cause regressions in edge cases, please report with stack traces (#10567)\r\n  * Added `--patch-only` to the `outdated` command to only show updates to patch versions and ignore new major/minor versions (#10589)\r\n  * Added clickable links to various commands for terminals which support it (#10430)\r\n  * Added ProcessExecutor ability to receive commands as arrays by (internals/plugin change only) (#10435)\r\n  * Added abandoned flag to `show`/`outdated` commands JSON-formatted output (#10485)\r\n  * Added config.reference option to `path` repositories to configure the way the reference is generated, and possibly reduce composer.lock conflicts (#10488)\r\n  * Added automatic removal of allow-plugins rules when removing a plugin via the `remove` command (#10615)\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQ & COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQS env vars to configure the equivalent flags (#10616)\r\n  * Added support for Symfony

problems\r\n\r\n- If you see errors with missing commands (`symfony-cmd: command not found`) or other failures and you are relying on plugins and running Composer as root (for example when you use **AWS ElasticBeanstalk**), read https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11839\r\n- If you are using plugins and bitbucket pipelines, read https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11839\r\n- If you see `Fatal error: Declaration of {some-class}::execute(...) must be compatible with Composer\\Command\\SomeCommand::execute(): int` then whatever code is extending a Composer command needs to be updated to also add the int return type, see https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11843 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Complete Changelog\r\n\r\n  * Security: Fixed code execution and possible

Read the [Composer 2.3 Release Announcement](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-3/) for more details on the release highlights.\r\n\r\n### Complete Changelog\r\n\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum PHP version is now 7.2.5+, use the [Composer 2.2 LTS](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/10340) if you are stuck with an older PHP (#10343)\r\n  * BC Break: added native parameter & return types to many internal APIs, we explicitly left the most extended/implemented symbols untouched but if this causes problems nonetheless please report it ASAP (#10547, #10561)\r\n  * BC Break: added visibility to all constants, a few internal ones have been made private/protected, if this causes problems please report it ASAP (#10550)\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum supported Symfony components version is now 5.4, this only affects you if you are requiring composer/composer directly however, which is generally frowned upon\r\n  * Bumped `composer-plugin-api` to `2.3.0`\r\n  * Bumped bundled Symfony components from 2.8 to 5.4 🥳\r\n  * Added `declare(strict_types=1)` to all the classes, which for sure could cause regressions in edge cases, please report with stack traces (#10567)\r\n  * Added `--patch-only` to the `outdated` command to only show updates to patch versions and ignore new major/minor versions (#10589)\r\n  * Added clickable links to various commands for terminals which support it (#10430)\r\n  * Added ProcessExecutor ability to receive commands as arrays by (internals/plugin change only) (#10435)\r\n  * Added abandoned flag to `show`/`outdated` commands JSON-formatted output (#10485)\r\n  * Added config.reference option to `path` repositories to configure the way the reference is generated, and possibly reduce composer.lock conflicts (#10488)\r\n  * Added automatic removal of allow-plugins rules when removing a plugin via the `remove` command (#10615)\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQ & COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQS env vars to configure the equivalent flags (#10616)\r\n  * Added support for Symfony 6.0 components\r\n  * Added support for psr/log 3.x (#10454)\r\n  * Fixed symlink creation in linux VM guest filesystems to be recognized by Windows (#10592)\r\n  * Performance improvement in pool optimization step (#10585)\r\n  * Performance improvement in Composer bootstrapping (version guessing) when on a feature branch (#10632)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/63134040/reactions","total_count":42,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":26,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":5,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/63078069","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/63078069/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/63078069/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.2.10","id":63078069,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABxyq84Dwn61","tag_name":"2.2.10","target_commitish":"18f748df692b6304b5baf077786c003c48e7f990","name":"2.2.10","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-03-29T19:55:36Z","published_at":"2022-03-29T20:04:36Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/assets/60968482","id":60968482,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABxyq84Dok4i","name":"composer.phar","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":2365223,"download_count":4914,"created_at":"2022-03-29T20:02:02Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T20:02:03Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/2.2.10/composer.phar"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/assets/60968485","id":60968485,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABxyq84Dok4l","name":"composer.phar.asc","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":589,"download_count":33144,"created_at":"2022-03-29T20:02:04Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T20:02:05Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/2.2.10/compo

2.3 is ready for a release, and we need your help to help test it and report any regression.\r\n\r\nThis release is special as it contains almost only **big internal changes** allowing us to modernize our PHP code:\r\n\r\n- **Upgraded minimum supported PHP** version from 5.3.2 to 7.2.5\r\n- **Upgraded symfony component** dependencies from 2.8.x to 5.4.x\r\n- **Added scalar parameter types** where possible, this should not break anything as [PHP 7.2 contravariance allows this](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.variance.php)\r\n- **Added return types** where possible. This will break code that extends ours and does not declare the same return types. For this reason, our most extended classes/interfaces have not been modified to retain BC: `Composer\\IO\\*`, `Composer\\Installer\\*`, `Composer\\Autoload\\ClassLoader`, `Composer\\InstalledVersions`, `Composer\\Plugin\\*`, `Composer\\Repository\\*`, `Composer\\Util\\{Filesystem,HttpDownloader,RemoteFilesystem}` and a few select others. Hopefully this avoids most breakage, but we may still see some extensions break. **If you can fix these breakages by adding return types and move on that would be the preferred way, but if they are breaking established plugins or others which cannot easily be updated everywhere they're used we will rollback those return type additions as needed.**\r\n- **Added `declare(strict_types=1)`** to all files, which is likely to break some edge case things which were not caught by the test suite.\r\n\r\nWe'd be very glad if anyone can **try it out** with their projects, and **especially for people extending Composer in some way (plugin or other)** to try it out.\r\n\r\n### Please try it out!\r\n\r\n- Running `composer self-update --preview` will get you the 2.3.0-RC1 (if you are running PHP 7.2.5 or above)\r\n- Running `composer self-update --stable` will get you back on the latest 2.2 stable release if things broke.\r\n- Report any issues you encounter as a new issue specifying you tried the 2.3 RC and please include stack traces & repro details.\r\n\r\n### Full Changelog\r\n\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum PHP version is now 7.2.5+, use the [Composer 2.2 LTS](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/10340) if you are stuck with an older PHP (#10343)\r\n  * BC Break: added native parameter & return types to many internal APIs, we explicitly left the most extended/implemented symbols untouched but if this causes problems nonetheless please report it ASAP (#10547, #10561)\r\n  * BC Break: added visibility to all constants, a few internal ones have been made private/protected, if this causes problems please report it ASAP (#10550)\r\n  * BC Break: the minimum supported Symfony components version is now 5.4, this only affects you if you are requiring composer/composer directly however, which is generally frowned upon\r\n  * Bumped `composer-plugin-api` to `2.3.0`\r\n  * Bumped bundled Symfony components from 2.8 to 5.4 🥳\r\n  * Added `declare(strict_types=1)` to all the classes, which for sure could cause regressions in edge cases, please report with stack traces (#10567)\r\n  * Added `--patch-only` to the `outdated` command to only show updates to patch versions and ignore new major/minor versions (#10589)\r\n  * Added clickable links to various commands for terminals which support it (#10430)\r\n  * Added ProcessExecutor ability to receive commands as arrays by (internals/plugin change only) (#10435)\r\n  * Added abandoned flag to `show`/`outdated` commands JSON-formatted output (#10485)\r\n  * Added config.reference option to `path` repositories to configure the way the reference is generated, and possibly reduce composer.lock conflicts (#10488)\r\n  * Added automatic removal of allow-plugins rules when removing a plugin via the `remove` command (#10615)\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQ & COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFOR_REQS env vars to configure the equivalent flags (#10616)\r\n  * Added support for Symfony 6.0 components\r\n  * Added support for psr/log 3.x (#10454)\r\n  * Fixed symlink creation in linux VM guest filesystems to be recognized by Windows (#10592)\r\n  * Performance improvement in pool optimization step (#10585)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/61971119/reactions","total_count":41,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":16,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":9,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/61932642","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/61932642/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/61932642/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.2.9","id":61932642,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABxyq84DsQRi","tag_name":"2.2.9","target_commitish":"07eccf080ad63d55d95a7c9133506db7d9029264","name":"2.2.9","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-03-15T21:13:38Z","published_at":"2022-03-15T21:21:46Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/assets/59597819","id":59597819,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABxyq84DjWP7","name":"composer.phar","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":2364320,"download_count":56207,"created_at":"2022-03-15T21:18:32Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T21:18:33Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/2.2.9/composer.phar"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/assets/59597820","id":59597820,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABxyq84DjWP8","name":"composer.phar.asc","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":589,"download_count":34268,"created_at":"2022-03-15T21:18:33Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T21:18:34Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/2.2.9/composer

Read the [Composer 2.2 Release Announcement](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-2/) for more details on the release highlights.\r\n\r\n### Complete Changelog\r\n\r\n  * Bumped `composer-runtime-api` and `composer-plugin-api` to `2.2.0`\r\n  * UX Change: Added [`allow-plugins`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#allow-plugins) config value to enhance security against runtime execution, this will prompt you the first time you use a plugin and may hang pipelines if they aren't using --no-interaction (-n) as they should (#10314)\r\n  * Added an optimization pass to reduce the amount of redundant inspected during resolution, drastically improving memory and CPU usage (#9261, #9620)\r\n  * Added a [global $_composer_autoload_path variable](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/vendor-binaries.md#finding-the-composer-autoloader-from-a-binary) containing the path to autoload.php for binaries (#10137)\r\n  * Added wildcard support to --ignore-platform-req (e.g. `ext-*`) (#10083)\r\n  * Added support for ignoring the upper bound of platform requirements using \"name+\" notation e.g. using `--ignore-platform-req=php+` would allow installing a package requiring `php: 8.0.*` on PHP 8.1, but not on PHP 7.4. Useful for CI builds of upcoming PHP versions (#10318)\r\n  * Added support for setting platform packages to false in config.platform to disable/hide them (#10308)\r\n  * Added [`use-parent-dir`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#use-parent-dir) option to configure the prompt for using composer.json in upper directory when none is present in current dir (#10307)\r\n  * Added [`composer` platform package](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/composer-platform-dependencies.md) which is always the exact version of Composer running unlike `composer-*-api` packages (#10313)\r\n  * Added a --source flag to `config` command to show where config values are loaded from (#10129)\r\n  * Added support for `files` autoloaders in the runtime scripts/plugins contexts (#10065)\r\n  * Added retry behavior on certain http status and curl error codes (#10162)\r\n  * Added abandoned flag display in search command output\r\n  * Added support for --ignore-platform-reqs in `outdated` command (#10293)\r\n  * Added --only-vendor (-O) flag to `search` command to search (and return) vendor names (#10336)\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_NO_DEV environment variable to set the --no-dev flag (#10262)\r\n  * Added support for using `dev-main` as the default path repo package version if no VCS info is available (#10372)\r\n  * Added --no-scripts as a globally supported flag to all Composer commands to disable scripts execution (#10371)\r\n  * Fixed `archive` command to behave more like git archive, gitignore/hgignore are not taken into account anymore, and gitattributes support was improved (#10309)\r\n  * Fixed unlocking of replacers when a replaced package is unlocked (#10280)\r\n  * Fixed auto-unlocked path repo packages also unlocking their transitive deps when -w/-W is used (#10157)\r\n  * Fixed handling of recursive package links (e.g. requiring or replacing oneself)\r\n  * Fixed env var reads to check $_SERVER and $_ENV before getenv for broader ecosystem compatibility (#10218)\r\n  * Fixed `archive` command to produce archives with files sorted by name (#10274)\r\n  * Fixed VcsRepository issues where server failure could cause missing tags/branches

Composer 2.2 will be LTS\r\n\r\n[Read more](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/10340) about the LTS plan and PHP version support in the upcoming Composer 2.3 if you're using a legacy PHP version.\r\n\r\n## Try it out now and get ready for the upcoming stable release\r\n\r\n- Use `composer self-update --preview` to try the latest prerelease version.\r\n- Use `composer self-update --stable` to go back to stable releases.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n  * Bumped `composer-runtime-api` and `composer-plugin-api` to `2.2.0`\r\n  * UX Change: Added [`allow-plugins`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#allow-plugins) config value to enhance security against runtime execution, this will prompt you the first time you use a plugin and may hang pipelines if they aren't using --no-interaction (-n) as they should (#10314)\r\n  * Added an optimization pass to reduce the amount of redundant inspected during resolution, drastically improving memory and CPU usage (#9261, #9620)\r\n  * Added a [global $_composer_autoload_path variable](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/vendor-binaries.md#finding-the-composer-autoloader-from-a-binary) containing the path to autoload.php for binaries (#10137)\r\n  * Added wildcard support to --ignore-platform-req (e.g. `ext-*`) (#10083)\r\n  * Added support for ignoring the upper bound of platform requirements using \"name+\" notation e.g. using `--ignore-platform-req=php+` would allow installing a package requiring `php: 8.0.*` on PHP 8.1, but not on PHP 7.4. Useful for CI builds of upcoming PHP versions (#10318)\r\n  * Added support for setting platform packages to false in config.platform to disable/hide them (#10308)\r\n  * Added support for `files` autoloaders in the runtime scripts/plugins contexts (#10065)\r\n  * Added [`use-parent-dir`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#use-parent-dir) option to configure the prompt for using composer.json in upper directory when none is present in current dir (#10307)\r\n  * Added [`composer` platform package](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/composer-platform-dependencies.md) which is always the exact version of Composer running unlike `composer-*-api` packages (#10313)\r\n  * Added a --source flag to `config` command to show where config values are loaded from (#10129)\r\n  * Added retry behavior on certain http status and curl error codes (#10162)\r\n  * Added abandoned flag display in search command output\r\n  * Added support for --ignore-platform-reqs in `outdated` command (#10293)\r\n  * Added --only-vendor (-O) flag to `search` command to search (and return) vendor names (#10336)\r\n  * Added COMPOSER_NO_DEV environment variable to set the --no-dev flag (#10262)\r\n  * Fixed `archive` command to behave more like git archive, gitignore/hgignore are not taken into account anymore, and gitattributes support was improved (#10309)\r\n  * Fixed unlocking of replacers when a replaced package is unlocked (#10280)\r\n  * Fixed auto-unlocked path repo packages also unlocking their transitive deps when -w/-W is used (#10157)\r\n  * Fixed handling of recursive package links (e.g. requiring or replacing oneself)\r\n  * Fixed env var reads to check $_SERVER and $_ENV before getenv for broader ecosystem compatibility (#10218)\r\n  * Fixed `archive` command to produce archives with files sorted by name (#10274)\r\n  * Fixed VcsRepository issues where server failure could cause missing tags/branches (#10319)\r\n  * Fixed some error reporting issues (#10283, #10339)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/54877235/reactions","total_count":27,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":11,"rocket":16,"eyes":0}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/54306609","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/54306609/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/54306609/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.1.14","id":54306609,"author":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOABxyq84DPKcx","tag_name":"2.1.14","target_commitish":"cd28fc05b0c9d3beaf58b57018725c4dc15a6446","name":"2.1.14","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2021-11-30T09:51:43Z","published_at":"2021-11-30T09:58:13Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/assets/50626586","id":50626586,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABxyq84DBIAa","name":"composer.phar","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":2291189,"download_count":245658,"created_at":"2021-11-30T09:54:42Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T09:54:42Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/2.1.14/composer.phar"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/composer/composer/releases/assets/50626589","id":50626589,"node_id":"RA_kwDOABxyq84DBIAd","name":"composer.phar.asc","label":"","uploader":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/octet-stream","state":"uploaded","size":589,"download_count":36341,"created_at":"2021-11-30T09:54:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T09:54:43Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/download/2.1.14/com
