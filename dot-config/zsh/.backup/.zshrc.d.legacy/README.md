# ZSH Legacy Configuration Consolidation

## Purpose
This directory contains the consolidated legacy ZSH configuration modules, refactored from the original 42 scattered modules into 9 logical, independent modules.

## Directory Structure
- `raw-modules/` - Source modules copied from `.zshrc.d/` and `.zshrc.d.disabled/`
- `consolidated-modules/` - New logical modules (target: 9 modules)
- `INVENTORY.md` - Module inventory and consolidation plan

## Module Naming Convention
- `ACTIVE-*.zsh` - Copied from `.zshrc.d/` (currently active)
- `DISABLED-*.zsh` - Copied from `.zshrc.d.disabled/` (inactive)

## Planned Consolidated Structure
1. `01-core-infrastructure.zsh` - Core shell infrastructure, logging, helpers
2. `02-security-integrity.zsh` - Security checks and plugin integrity
3. `03-performance-monitoring.zsh` - Performance monitoring, async, caching
4. `04-completion-system.zsh` - Completion management and finalization
5. `05-environment-options.zsh` - Shell options, environment setup
6. `06-development-tools.zsh` - Development toolchains and external tools
7. `07-user-interface.zsh` - Prompt, aliases, keybindings, UI
8. `08-plugin-metadata.zsh` - Plugin metadata and maintenance
9. `09-legacy-compatibility.zsh` - Compatibility shims

## Safety Features
- Original configuration backed up in `.zshrc.d.original-backup/`
- No changes to active configuration until symlink phase
- Each consolidated module designed to be independently testable
- Progressive deployment via symlinks for instant rollback

## Next Steps
Phase 2: Create consolidated modules
Phase 3: Test and deploy via symlinks
