Backup / Removal Note: .zgenom symlink
-------------------------------------

Removed symlink: zsh/.zgenom -> zgenom
Removal time (local): 2025-08-28T15:39:03+01:00
Removed by: automated assistant (action requested by repository owner)
Reason: redundant duplicate reference; canonicalized ZDOTDIR layout (stow-managed)
Repository canonical location: ~/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh
Runtime (stowed) location: ~/.config/zsh -> ~/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh

Details
-------
- The symlink `zsh/.zgenom` pointed to the sibling directory `zgenom/`.
- The `zgenom/` directory remains intact in the repository and is the canonical vendor for the zgenom plugin manager files.
- Removing `zsh/.zgenom` only removed the redundant symlink. No plugin data, clones, or other files were deleted.
- This change reduces duplicate references and avoids interfering with stow-managed layout where `~/.config/zsh` is a symlink to the repo.

Suggested follow-up (manual)
----------------------------
If you want an audit/backed-up copy of the symlink metadata, you can create a small file (example below) and commit it alongside your README. This file is intended as that record.

Example backup file contents (already recorded here):
- Filename suggestion: `zsh/.zgenom.removed-2025-08-28T15-39-03.txt`
- Contents: this file (the recorded removal details)

Suggested commit message (short)
-------------------------------
zsh: document canonical ZDOTDIR layout; remove redundant .zgenom symlink

Suggested commit message (detailed)
----------------------------------
zsh: remove redundant top-level .zgenom symlink and document ZDOTDIR layout

- Removed duplicate symlink `zsh/.zgenom` (now relying on `zgenom/` directory)
- Add README documenting canonical repo (`~/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh`) → runtime (`~/.config/zsh`) layout
- Rationale: avoid duplicate references and make stow-managed layout the single source of truth
- Removal timestamp: 2025-08-28T15:39:03+01:00

Suggested USAGE.md (short) — copy into `zsh/USAGE.md`
---------------------------------------------------
Purpose
This project keeps the canonical Zsh configuration in:
  ~/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh

You should use GNU stow to create the runtime symlink:
  ~/.config/zsh -> ~/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh

Typical commands
From the repo root (~/dotfiles/dot-config):
  # To stow the zsh folder into ~/.config
  stow -t $HOME/.config zsh

  # Or, from ~/dotfiles/dot-config:
  cd ~/dotfiles/dot-config
  stow zsh

Notes
- Keep all canonical configuration files under `zsh/` in this repo so stow can manage them cleanly.
- Do not create duplicate symlinks at the repo root that point to files inside `zsh/`. These duplicates can confuse stow and other tooling.
- If you intentionally want user-local plugin clones (e.g. `~/.zgenom`), the init logic in `.zshenv`/.zshrc` will fall back to `${HOME}/.zgenom` when needed.

Example troubleshooting
- If zgenom is expected to live in `~/.zgenom` for runtime use:
  - The code already checks these locations (in priority order):
    1) `$ZDOTDIR/.zqs-zgenom`
    2) `$ZDOTDIR/zgenom`
    3) `${HOME}/.zgenom`
  - If you prefer a localized plugin store under the stowed config, allow `ZGEN_DIR` to point to `${ZDOTDIR}/.zgenom`.
