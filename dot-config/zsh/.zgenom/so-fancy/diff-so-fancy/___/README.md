`diff-so-fancy` strives to make your diffs **human** readable instead of machine readable. This helps improve code quality and helps you spot defects faster.

## üì¶ Install

Simply copy the `diff-so-fancy` script from the latest release into your `$PATH` and you're done. Alternately to test development features you can clone this repo and then put the `diff-so-fancy` script (symlink will work) into your `$PATH`. The `lib/` directory will need to be kept relative to the core script.

`diff-so-fancy` is also available from the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff-so-fancy), [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/diff-so-fancy), [Fedora](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/diff-so-fancy/diff-so-fancy/), in the [Arch extra repo](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/diff-so-fancy/), and as [ppa:aos for Debian/Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/aos/dsf-debian).

Issues relating to packaging ("installation does not work", "version is out of date", etc.) should be directed to those packages' repositories/issue trackers where applicable.

## ‚ú® Usage

### With git

Configure git to use `diff-so-fancy` for all diff output:

```shell
git config --global core.pager "diff-so-fancy | less --tabs=4 -RF"
git config --global interactive.diffFilter "diff-so-fancy --patch"
```

### Manually with diff

Use `-u` with `diff` for unified output, and pipe the output to `diff-so-fancy`:

```shell
diff -u file_a file_b | diff-so-fancy
```

It also supports the recursive mode of diff with `-r` or `--recursive` as **first argument**

```shell
diff -r -u folder_a folder_b | diff-so-fancy
```

```shell
diff --recursive -u folder_a folder_b | diff-so-fancy
```
## ‚öíÔ∏è Options

### markEmptyLines

Should the first block of an empty line be colored. (Default: true)

```shell
git config --bool --global diff-so-fancy.markEmptyLines false
```

### changeHunkIndicators

Simplify git header chunks to a more human readable format. (Default: true)

```shell
git config --bool --global diff-so-fancy.changeHunkIndicators false
```

### stripLeadingSymbols

Should the pesky `+` or `-` at line-start be removed. (Default: true)

```shell
git config --bool --global diff-so-fancy.stripLeadingSymbols false
```

### useUnicodeRuler

By default, the separator for the file header uses Unicode line-drawing characters. If this is causing output errors on your terminal, set this to `false` to use ASCII characters instead. (Default: true)

```shell
git config --bool --global diff-so-fancy.useUnicodeRuler false
```

### rulerWidth

By default, the separator for the file header spans the full width of the terminal. Use this setting to set the width of the file header manually.

```shell
git config --global diff-so-fancy.rulerWidth 80
```
