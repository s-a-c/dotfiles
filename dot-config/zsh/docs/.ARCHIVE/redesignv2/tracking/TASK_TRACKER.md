**Last Updated:** 2025-09-10 (Part 08.19 ‚Äì Instrumentation Status Refresh)  
**Current Stage:** Stage 4 (Sprint 2 ‚Äì Instrumentation & Telemetry)  
**Next Milestone:** Segment Probes + Logging Homogeneity (INTEGRATED ‚Üí shifting focus to governance & opt-in telemetry)

### Sprint 2 Status Snapshot (Part 08.19.10)
- Logging homogeneity COMPLETE (legacy underscore wrappers removed; no `ZF_LOG_LEGACY_USED`; gate test green)
- Real segment probes ACTIVE (anchors: `pre_plugin_start`, `pre_plugin_total`, `post_plugin_total`, `prompt_ready`, `deferred_total` + granular feature/dev-env/history/security/ui attribution)
- Deferred dispatcher skeleton OPERATIONAL (one-shot postprompt; stable `DEFERRED id=<id> ms=<int> rc=<rc>` telemetry)
- Structured telemetry flags AVAILABLE & inert when unset: `ZSH_LOG_STRUCTURED`, `ZSH_PERF_JSON` (zero overhead disabled path)
- Multi-metric performance classifier in OBSERVE mode (Warn 10% / Fail 25%); enforce flip (S4-33) pending 3√ó consecutive OK streak
- Dependency export (`zf::deps::export`) JSON + DOT + basic tests COMPLETE
- Privacy appendix PUBLISHED (redaction whitelist stabilized; referenced across docs)
- Baseline unchanged: 334ms cold start (RSD 1.9%) after new instrumentation
- Immediate focus: 
  * S4-27 idle/background trigger design & stubs (ref: feature/IDLE_DEFERRED_TRIGGER_DESIGN.md)
  * S4-18 telemetry opt-in plumbing (`ZSH_FEATURE_TELEMETRY`) (ref: IMPLEMENTATION.md Telemetry Opt-In Plumbing section)
  * S4-29 homogeneity documentation finalization (namespace rules)
  * S4-30 classifier legend + PERFORMANCE_LOG governance row template integration
  * S4-33 enforce-mode activation procedure (track OK streak & readiness checklist)

## Recently Completed (Part 08.19.10)

### ‚úÖ GOAL & CI ‚Äî Latest Completions (08.19.10)
- Classifier single-metric JSON ordering moved earlier to ensure ‚Äúalways-before-exit‚Äù parity with multi-metric (deterministic artifacts even on enforce failures).
- Capture-runner stderr noise (‚Äúbad math expression‚Äù) suppressed without altering capture logic or metrics.
- Dynamic badges:
  - goal-state badge emitted at docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/goal-state.json
  - summary-goal badge emitted at docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/summary-goal.json (folds in perf-drift and structure badges; color reflects worst severity)
- CI wiring:
  - Strict classifier workflow (GOAL=ci enforce) generates perf-current.json and goal-state badge; artifacts uploaded.
  - Nightly publisher runs classifier, generates goal-state + summary-goal badges, ensures perf-drift & structure badges, and publishes to gh-pages with index.
  - Post-publish step auto-replaces README placeholders with repo-specific Shields endpoints once badges land on gh-pages.
- Test suite: remaining T-GOAL-02..06 executed and passing with gawk available; tests gracefully skip if gawk is missing; JSON parsing regexes hardened.

### ‚úÖ Deferred Dispatcher Skeleton
- One-shot post-first prompt execution
- Registration API: `zf::defer::register <id> <func> postprompt <desc>`
- Telemetry line: `DEFERRED id=<id> ms=<int> rc=<rc>`
- Dummy warm job: `dummy-warm` (ensures path exercised)

### ‚úÖ Dependency Cycle Edge-Case Test Suite
- Unknown dependency handling
- Disabled dependency suppression
- Multi-level cycle detection
- Cycle broken by disabled node (isolation)

### ‚úÖ Cycle Detector Enhancements
- Disabled filtering toggle
- Scope limiting via `ZF_CYCLE_SCOPE`
- Include-disabled optional scan flag

### ‚úÖ Logging Namespace Migration (Phase 1)
- Introduced `zf::log`, `zf::warn`, `zf::err`
- Legacy underscore wrappers retained temporarily (compat marker `ZF_LOG_LEGACY_USED`)

### ‚úÖ Telemetry & Deferred Documentation Expansion
- IMPLEMENTATION.md ¬ß2.2 enriched (DEFERRED / SEGMENT formats)
- Performance Log scaffold updated (deferred placeholder row)

### ‚úÖ Baseline Performance Revalidated
- 334ms startup, 1.9% variance (no regression after dispatcher integration)

## Recently Completed (Part 08.18)

### ‚úÖ Manifest Test Hardening
- **Issue:** Test failed when run with `zsh -f` (no startup files)
- **Root Causes:**
  1. Core functions not sourced automatically
  2. Associative array syntax incompatible with `::` in keys
  3. Debug function (`zsh_debug_echo`) unavailable in clean shell
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Added automatic sourcing of `10-core-functions.zsh` module
  - Fixed associative array syntax: `HASH[$key]=value` (no quotes)
  - Replaced debug function with conditional echo statements
  - Updated manifest with missing functions (`zf::exports`, `zf::script_dir`)
- **Verification:** Test passes in both direct execution and CI runner

### ‚úÖ Test Runner Migration
- **Issue:** Legacy runner (`run-all-tests.zsh`) did not enforce isolation and was referenced in CI/docs
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Migrated all CI workflows and documentation to `run-all-tests-v2.zsh`
  - Deprecated legacy runner and added warning header
  - Updated onboarding and quick start guides
- **Verification:** All CI and documentation now reference new runner; isolation (`zsh -f`) enforced

### ‚úÖ CI Enforcement & Documentation Update
- All progress trackers, onboarding, and reference docs updated
- Manifest test passes in isolation and CI
- Performance: 334ms startup, 1.9% variance

## Active Tasks (In Progress)

### üöÄ Stage 4 Sprint 2 (Instrumentation & Telemetry Expansion)

#### Next Steps to progress & complete Sprint 2 (Part 08.19.10)
- [x] Add CI assertion to fail when summary-goal severity collapses to red in publisher workflow
- [x] Add tiny integration check to ensure summary-goal.json exists whenever goal-state.json exists
- [x] Add minimal test validating summary-goal suffix composition (drift/struct) and keep it resilient
- [x] Document badge legend and README notes for goal-state and summary-goal, including severity mapping and suffix rules
- [ ] Monitor next gh-pages publish to confirm both badges (goal-state.json, summary-goal.json) are present
- [ ] Verify README auto-resolves placeholder endpoints to <org>/<repo> after publish
- [ ] Validate resilience: missing perf-drift.json/structure.json yields no suffix and does not raise severity
- [ ] Confirm dependency coverage: gawk ensured on macOS runner; ubuntu-latest uses GNU awk; tests skip gracefully if absent
- [ ] Decide on optional mapping refinements:
  - Governance: treat BASELINE_CREATED as informational vs. clean
  - Streak: consider nuanced ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù based on number/nature of missing metrics

##### Exit Criteria (Sprint 2)
- First gh-pages publish contains badges/goal-state.json and badges/summary-goal.json
- README endpoints auto-resolved to the real repository
- CI publisher fails runs on red summary-goal severity (guardrail active)
- Summary-goal suffix test passes in CI; logs remain free of ‚Äúbad math expression‚Äù noise
- Resilience confirmed: absence of suffix sources does not inflate severity
