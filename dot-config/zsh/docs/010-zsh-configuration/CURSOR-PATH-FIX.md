# Cursor PATH Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: ✅ Implemented, awaiting user testing

---

## Problem Discovered

**Root Cause**: Chicken-and-egg problem in `.zshenv.01`

1. Cursor/VSCode starts ZSH with incomplete PATH (Cursor extension dirs first, system dirs missing or pushed back)
2. Terminal detection code (lines 28-70) runs `ps` and `grep` commands
3. These commands FAIL because `/usr/bin` isn't in PATH yet
4. PATH was being set at line 73 - AFTER terminal detection tried to use it
5. Result: "command not found" errors during startup

---

## The Fix

**Simple but Critical**: Move PATH initialization BEFORE terminal detection.

### Changed Lines in `.zshenv.01`

**Line 26** (NEW):
```zsh
# --- Initialize PATH FIRST ---
# CRITICAL: Set PATH before running ANY commands (ps, grep, etc.)
# Some terminals (Cursor, VSCode) provide incomplete PATH that breaks terminal detection
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:${PATH}"
```

**Lines 28-70**: Terminal detection (unchanged, but now works because PATH is set first)

**Line 73**: Removed duplicate PATH export (was here, now at line 26)

**Line 474-475**: Updated comment to reflect new line numbers

---

## Why This Works

**Execution Order**:
```
1. Line 26:   export PATH="..." ✅ Set system directories FIRST
2. Lines 28-70: Terminal detection      ✅ ps/grep now work
3. Rest of startup                      ✅ All commands work
```

**Before (Broken)**:
```
1. Lines 28-70: Terminal detection  ❌ ps/grep fail (PATH incomplete)
2. Line 73:     export PATH="..."  ✅ Too late - errors already happened
```

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.zshenv.01` | Moved PATH export from line 73 to line 26 (before terminal detection) |
| `.zshenv.01` | Removed duplicate PATH export |
| `.zshenv.01` | Updated line number comment |
| `docs/130-troubleshooting.md` | Updated section 2.2.1 with explanation |
| `docs/P2.4-RESOLUTION-SUMMARY.md` | Updated with root cause & fix |

## Testing Required

### Primary Test: Cursor Integrated Terminal

1. **Completely close ALL Cursor terminal tabs**
2. **Quit and restart Cursor** (Cmd+Q, relaunch)
3. **Open fresh integrated terminal** (Ctrl+` or Terminal → New Terminal)
4. **Watch for errors** during startup

**Expected result**: **NO** "command not found" errors

**Verify**:
```bash
# Should show "vscode"
echo $TERM_PROGRAM

# Should show system dirs early
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | head -10
```

### Regression Test: Other Terminals

Test in each terminal to ensure no regression:
- WezTerm
- Warp
- Kitty
- iTerm2
- Ghostty

All should:
- Have correct `$TERM_PROGRAM`
- Have correct PATH (system dirs present)
- Show NO startup errors

---

## Impact

✅ **Fixes**: Cursor/VSCode "command not found" errors
✅ **Benefits**: SSH, tmux, screen, GUI launchers (any environment with incomplete initial PATH)
✅ **Simpler**: Single PATH initialization, no complex conditional logic
✅ **Defensive**: Works for ALL environments, even future unknown ones

---

## Next Steps

1. **User tests in Cursor terminal**
2. **User tests in all other terminals (regression check)**
3. **If tests pass**: Mark P2.4 as TESTED in roadmap
4. **If tests fail**: Investigate further and revise
