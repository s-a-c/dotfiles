## P2.1 Performance Log Accumulation

**Status**: Implemented and Active

**What Was Done**:

- Added age-based log cleanup to `050-logging-and-monitoring.zsh`
- Automatically removes perf-*.log files older than 7 days
- Configurable via `ZF_LOG_ROTATION_AGE_DAYS` environment variable
- Works alongside existing size-based rotation (200KB threshold)

**Code Location**: `.zshrc.pre-plugins.d.01/050-logging-and-monitoring.zsh:81-87`

**Testing**:

```bash
# Verify log rotation is active
zsh -i -c "source ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc && echo \$_ZF_LOG_ROTATION"
# Should output: 1

# Check for old logs (should be removed on next shell start)
ls -lt ~/.config/zsh/.logs/perf-*.log

# Customize rotation age
export ZF_LOG_ROTATION_AGE_DAYS=14  # Keep for 2 weeks instead
```

## P2.2 Test Coverage Improvement

**Status**: Comprehensive Plan Created

**What Was Done**:

- Analyzed test coverage across all module categories
- Identified specific gaps: Terminal (70%), Platform (60%), Error paths (75%)
- Created 6-week implementation schedule
- Documented test structure guidelines with examples
- Defined success metrics (90%+ target)

**Documentation**: [TEST-COVERAGE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md](TEST-COVERAGE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md)

**Implementation Schedule**:

- **Week 1-2**: Terminal integration tests (+15% coverage)
- **Week 3-4**: Platform-specific tests (+20% coverage)
- **Week 5-6**: Error handling tests (+10% coverage)
- **Result**: 85% ‚Üí 90%+ coverage

**Next Steps**:

1. Create `tests/unit/terminal-integration/` directory
2. Write tests for all 7 supported terminal emulators
3. Validate coverage improvement

## P2.3 Plugin Loading Optimization

**Status**: Fully Analyzed - Implementation Plan Ready

**What Was Done**:

- Inventoried all 12 plugin files and ~15 loaded plugins
- Analyzed dependencies and categorized by defer priority
- Identified 230ms optimization potential (FZF excluded)
- Analyzed opportunities for ZSH builtin replacements
- Documented 4 lazy-loading strategies with code examples
- Created risk assessment for each plugin
- Designed 4-week phased implementation plan

**Documentation**: [PLUGIN-LAZY-ASYNC-PLAN.md](PLUGIN-LAZY-ASYNC-PLAN.md)

**Key Findings**:

**Phase 1: High-Impact, Low-Risk** (190ms savings):

```text
ZSH builtin replacements           ~10ms  - Replace stat, wc, ls, date, find
PHP plugins (composer, laravel)    ~80ms  - On-demand wrapper for 'composer'
                                            (Note: 'artisan' is 'php artisan', not a global command)
GitHub CLI (gh)                    ~60ms  - zsh-defer with 2s delay
Navigation (eza, zoxide)           ~40ms  - zsh-defer with 1s delay
```

**Phase 2: Medium-Impact, Low-Risk** (40ms savings):

```text
Autopair                           ~20ms  - precmd hook (first prompt)
Abbreviation pack                  ~20ms  - Defer pack loading only
```

**Items Excluded from Plan**:

```text
FZF integration                    N/A    - Users expect instant Ctrl+R/Ctrl+T
                                            (may reconsider in future cycles)
```

**Performance Target**: 800ms ‚Üí 570ms (230ms savings, 29% improvement)

**Revised Strategy**:

- **Focus on low-risk optimizations** with high user satisfaction
- **Prioritize ZSH builtins** for portability and performance
- **Exclude FZF deferring** to maintain excellent UX for history/file search
- **4-week timeline** instead of 6 weeks (faster deployment)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This is a **PLANNING DOCUMENT ONLY**. DO NOT implement without explicit approval.

**Next Steps** (After Approval):

1. **Week 1**: Implement ZSH builtin replacements + `composer` wrapper (90ms savings)
   - Replace external utilities (stat, wc, ls, date, find) with ZSH builtins
   - Create `composer()` wrapper for on-demand PHP plugin loading
   - Note: `artisan` is `php artisan` (project-local), not a global command
2. **Week 2**: Implement GitHub + Navigation deferring (100ms savings)
3. **Week 3**: Implement Autopair + Abbreviation deferring (40ms savings)
4. **Week 4**: Final tuning, performance validation, documentation
