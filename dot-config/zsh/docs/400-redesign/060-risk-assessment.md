# 060 - Risk Assessment

## Top

Status: Draft

Last updated: 2025-10-07

This document contains the risk analysis for the redesign project, mitigation strategies, and contingency plans.

## Risk matrix (example)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Prompt duplication causing widget errors | Medium | High | Add widget-count checks during startup; add guard to avoid re-initialization |
| Symlink switch failure leaving user without config | Low | High | Validate symlink integrity before switching; provide emergency rollback script |
| Optional plugin causing slow startup | High | Medium | Defer loading; provide explicit enable/disable flags |

## Primary mitigations

- Implement pre-flight checks (widget count baseline, path verification)
- Provide an emergency rollback script and make it discoverable from `README`
- Ensure logging for startup errors and clear user-facing diagnostics

## Rollback and emergency procedures

- See: `040-implementation-guide.md` for `emergency-rollback.sh` examples and manual rollback steps

## Acceptance criteria

- Risk matrix is established for top risks with assigned mitigations
- Rollback procedure exists and is easily runnable by maintainers
