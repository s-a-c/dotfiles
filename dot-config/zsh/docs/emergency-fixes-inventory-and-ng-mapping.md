### Emergency Fixes Detailed Inventory

#### 1. System Command Availability Fixes
**Files:** `zsh_zshenv.zsh` (lines 14-23), `000-emergency-system-fix.zsh` (lines 15-25)
**Root Cause:** System PATH not reliably available during ZSH startup
**Emergency Functions Created:**
```bash
# DUPLICATE EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS (2 locations):
function sed() { /usr/bin/sed "$@"; }
function tr() { /usr/bin/tr "$@"; }
function uname() { /usr/bin/uname "$@"; }
function dirname() { /usr/bin/dirname "$@"; }
function basename() { /usr/bin/basename "$@"; }
function cat() { /bin/cat "$@"; }
function cc() { /usr/bin/cc "$@"; }
function make() { /usr/bin/make "$@"; }
function ld() { /usr/bin/ld "$@"; }
```
**Impact:** Critical - prevents "command not found" errors during startup

#### 2. PATH Management Emergency Fixes
**Files:** `zsh_zshenv.zsh` (lines 26-32), `000-emergency-system-fix.zsh` (lines 11-14)
**Root Cause:** PATH initialization happens too late in startup sequence
**Emergency PATH Setup:**
```bash
# DUPLICATE EMERGENCY PATH (2 locations):
export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
export PATH="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin:$PATH"
```
**Impact:** Critical - ensures system commands are available immediately

#### 3. Build Environment Emergency Setup
**Files:** `zsh_zshenv.zsh` (lines 34-38), `000-emergency-system-fix.zsh` (lines 27-36)
**Root Cause:** Build tools and environment variables not set early enough
**Emergency Build Environment:**
```bash
export CC="/usr/bin/cc"
export CXX="/usr/bin/c++"
export CPP="/usr/bin/cpp"
export DEVELOPER_DIR="${DEVELOPER_DIR:-/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer}"
```
**Impact:** High - prevents build failures and development tool issues

#### 4. NVM Integration Emergency Optimization
**File:** `000-emergency-system-fix.zsh` (lines 42-98)
**Root Cause:** Original NVM integration was extremely slow (2008ms startup impact)
**Emergency NVM Functions:**
- Ultra-fast `herd-load-nvmrc()` replacement (uses only ZSH builtins)
- Missing `nvm_find_nvmrc()` and `nvm_rc_version()` implementations
- ZSH-only directory traversal and file reading
**Impact:** High - reduces startup time by 2+ seconds

#### 5. Completion System Emergency Bulletproofing
**File:** `002-ultimate-compinit.zsh` (102 lines)
**Root Cause:** Completion system failures and corrupted completion cache
**Emergency Completion Features:**
- Safe `bashcompinit()` wrapper with fallbacks
- Bulletproof `compinit` with corruption recovery
- Multiple completion initialization strategies
- Cache validation and rebuilding
**Impact:** Critical - prevents completion system total failure

#### 6. Plugin Loading Emergency Guards
**File:** `005-plugin-loading-guards.zsh` (150+ lines)
**Root Cause:** Plugin conflicts and dependency issues causing failures
**Emergency Plugin Protection:**
- Plugin state tracking (`_PLUGIN_LOAD_STATE`)
- Conflict detection (`_PLUGIN_CONFLICTS`)
- Dependency validation (`_PLUGIN_DEPENDENCIES`)
- Safe plugin loading with rollback
**Impact:** High - prevents plugin system corruption

#### 7. Global Variable Creation Emergency Fixes
**File:** `000-emergency-system-fix.zsh` (lines 110-120)
**Root Cause:** ZSH warning about global variables created in functions
**Emergency Variable Pre-declaration:**
```bash
typeset -g BUN_INSTALL="${BUN_INSTALL:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/bun}"
typeset -g DOTNET_CLI_HOME="${DOTNET_CLI_HOME:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/dotnet}"
typeset -g NVM_SCRIPT_SOURCE="${NVM_SCRIPT_SOURCE:-}"
typeset -g SSH_AGENT_PID="${SSH_AGENT_PID:-}"
```
**Impact:** Medium - eliminates warning messages during startup

#### üîç Root Cause #3: Environment and Configuration Inconsistency
**Emergency Fixes Affected:** Global Variable Warnings, Build Environment
**Fundamental Problem:** Environment setup lacks validation and consistency checking

**Current Emergency Response:**
- Pre-declare global variables to avoid warnings
- Hardcode build environment variables
- Manual environment setup in multiple locations

**Root Cause Deep Analysis:**
```bash
ENVIRONMENT INCONSISTENCY SEQUENCE:
1. Environment variables set without validation
2. Global variable warnings from improper declarations
3. Build environment missing or incorrect
4. EMERGENCY: Pre-declare all possible global variables
5. EMERGENCY: Force build environment setup early
```

**Proposed .NG Prevention Architecture:**
```text
.zshrc.pre-plugins.d.ng/00-core/15-environment-validation.zsh
