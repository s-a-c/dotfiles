# ZSH Configuration Redesign – Implementation Guide

### Part 08.19.10 — Current Implementation Update

- GOAL profiles fully wired via internal flags (streak, governance, explore, ci). Enforce-mode gating is flags-driven; observe mode remains rc=0.
- Single-metric JSON emission now matches multi-metric ordering (always written before any enforce-mode exit).
- Capture-runner stderr noise (“bad math expression”) is suppressed without changing capture logic or metrics.
- Test matrix T-GOAL-01..06 stabilized and passing with gawk available; tests gracefully skip if gawk is missing; JSON parsing regexes hardened.
- Dynamic badges implemented:
  - goal-state badge: docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/goal-state.json
  - summary-goal badge (aggregator): docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/summary-goal.json (folds in perf drift and structure health)
- CI and publishing:
  - Strict classifier workflow (GOAL=ci enforce) emits docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/perf-current.json and generates goal-state badge; uploads artifacts.
  - Nightly publisher runs the classifier, generates goal-state and summary-goal badges, ensures perf-drift and structure badges, and publishes to gh-pages with an index.
  - Post-publish step auto-replaces README placeholders with correct shields endpoints once badges land on gh-pages.

Badge endpoints (placeholders; auto-resolved in README after first gh-pages publish):
- Goal-state (flat): https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/gh-pages/badges/goal-state.json
- Summary-goal (compact): https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/gh-pages/badges/summary-goal.json

### Stage 4 Sprint 2 Status (Part 08.19 Refresh)
- Logging homogeneity complete: legacy underscore wrappers removed; gate test green (no `ZF_LOG_LEGACY_USED`)
- Real segment probes active (anchors: `pre_plugin_start`, `pre_plugin_total`, `post_plugin_total`, `prompt_ready`, `deferred_total` + granular feature/dev-env/history/security/ui segments)
- Deferred dispatcher skeleton operational (one-shot postprompt; telemetry lines: `DEFERRED id=<id> ms=<int> rc=<rc>`)
- Structured telemetry flags available & inert when unset: `ZSH_LOG_STRUCTURED`, `ZSH_PERF_JSON` (zero-cost disabled path)
- Multi-metric performance classifier in observe mode (Warn 10% / Fail 25% thresholds); enforce activation (S4-33) pending 3× consecutive OK streak
- Dependency export (`zf::deps::export` JSON + DOT) and DOT generator integrated with initial validation tests
- Privacy appendix published & referenced (redaction whitelist stabilized)
- Baseline performance unchanged: 334ms cold start (RSD 1.9%) — no regression after new instrumentation
- Immediate focus: finalize homogeneity documentation updates (S4-29), add classifier legend row to PERFORMANCE_LOG (S4-30), implement idle/background trigger design (S4-27), implement telemetry opt-in plumbing (`ZSH_FEATURE_TELEMETRY`) (S4-18), prepare enforce-mode governance activation procedure (S4-33)
- Logging Homogeneity Policy Summary: Only `zf::log`, `zf::warn`, `zf::err` are approved; legacy underscore wrappers (`_zf_log`, `_zf_warn`, `_zf_err`) are prohibited and now enforced by homogeneity gate; raw `echo`/`print` for runtime logging disallowed except guarded diagnostics: `[[ ${ZSH_DEBUG:-0} == 1 ]] && print -- "[diag] ..."`
- Legacy Wrapper Removal Policy (Completed): Introduced namespaced APIs, instrumented transitional wrappers with sentinel `ZF_LOG_LEGACY_USED`, verified ≥2 consecutive clean runs (no sentinel set), removed wrappers, updated REFERENCE §5.4 & ARCHITECTURE; rollback only via emergency branch + governance PERFORMANCE_LOG row (Type=governance, Scope=logging-homogeneity).
- Developer Checklist (Homogeneity): (1) No underscore wrappers reintroduced, (2) No unguarded diagnostic `echo`, (3) Structured telemetry key additions accompanied by schema + privacy appendix update, (4) ADR required for any new logging helper variant, (5) Run design-only homogeneity test locally before commit.
- Compliance Header Update Note: The checksum in the compliance header must refresh automatically when `/dot-config/ai/guidelines.md` changes; all automation touching this file should validate and rewrite the header if mismatch is detected (policy guard for drift).



**Version:** 3.4  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-11 (Part 08.19 + GOAL Profiles)  
**Status:** Stage 4 – Sprint 2 (Instrumentation & Telemetry Expansion – classifier in observe mode; enforcement pending 3× OK streak)  
**Critical Update (Part 08.19):**  

### Telemetry Opt-In Plumbing (S4-18 Scaffold)

Purpose: Introduce gated feature timing & structured JSON export without altering baseline when disabled.

Scope (MVP):
- Environment Flag: `ZSH_FEATURE_TELEMETRY=1`
- Data Structures:
  - `typeset -A ZSH_FEATURE_TIMINGS_SYNC`
  - `typeset -A ZSH_FEATURE_TIMINGS_DEFERRED` (future / idle tasks)
- Capture Points:
  - Around feature registry init wrapper (synchronous phases only in MVP)
  - Optional hook after idle/background batch (future)
- Export (when both `ZSH_FEATURE_TELEMETRY=1` AND `ZSH_PERF_JSON=1`):
  - Append per-feature objects to structured telemetry JSON sidecar:
    ```
    {"type":"feature_timing","name":"<feature>","ms":<int>,"phase":"init","ts":<epoch_ms>}
    ```
- Overhead Constraints:
  - Disabled path: ≤ 0.05ms aggregate (single boolean check)
  - Enabled path: ≤ 0.5ms per feature timing (including associative array write)
- Failure Policy:
  - Missing timing boundary gracefully skips (no partial corrupt JSON)
  - Any exporter error logs via `zf::err` but does not abort startup

Test Plan (to be implemented):
| ID | Assertion |
|----|-----------|
| T-TEL-01 | Disabled path emits no feature_timing JSON |
| T-TEL-02 | Enabled path records ≥1 known feature timing key |
| T-TEL-03 | Timing values are integers >0 for instrumented features |
| T-TEL-04 | Overhead (disabled) difference vs baseline <0.5ms (5-run avg) |
| T-TEL-05 | Schema validator accepts new `feature_timing` type |
| T-TEL-06 | Privacy appendix lists `feature_timing` fields (name, ms, phase, ts) |

Next Steps:
1. Add flag evaluation + data structure declarations.
2. Instrument registry wrapper (start/stop timestamps).
3. Extend structured telemetry emitter with guarded `feature_timing` block.
4. Add schema + privacy appendix updates.
5. Implement tests T-TEL-01..T-TEL-05.
6. Update PERFORMANCE_LOG if measurable (>1ms) overhead detected (expected: none).

Governance Note: Enforce-mode flip for classifier (S4-33) contingent on telemetry addition showing zero delta to `prompt_ready_ms` in observe mode.

- Real segment probes COMPLETE (phase anchors + granular attribution: pre_plugin_start, pre_plugin_total, post_plugin_total, prompt_ready, deferred_total, plus feature/plugin segments)  
- Deferred dispatcher skeleton ACTIVE (one‑shot postprompt, cumulative `deferred_total` captured)  
- Multi-metric performance classifier integrated (observe mode: OK/WARN/FAIL thresholds 10% / 25%; enforce flip S4-33 pending 3 consecutive OK runs)  
- Governance readiness: PERFORMANCE_LOG governance placeholder + README performance status managed block (pending activation row on enforce flip)  
- Logging namespace migration COMPLETE (underscore wrappers removed; homogeneity gate enforced)  
- Structured telemetry flags AVAILABLE (`ZSH_LOG_STRUCTURED`, `ZSH_PERF_JSON`) – opt-in, zero overhead when unset; privacy appendix published and referenced  
- Dependency export + DOT generator integrated (`zf::deps::export --dot`) with basic tests green  
- New automation scripts: `tools/update-performance-status.zsh` (streak JSON) & `tools/sync-readme-performance-status.zsh` (managed README block)  
- README segment sync automation operational (`tools/sync-readme-segments.zsh` + CI drift check workflow)  
- Baseline stable: 334ms cold start (RSD 1.9%) – no regression after instrumentation additions  

This document is the authoritative reference for the ZSH configuration redesign implementation, consolidating all progress tracking, execution plans, and promotion readiness criteria.

### 4.x Classifier GOAL Profiles & Execution Semantics

The performance regression classifier now supports adaptive execution via a `GOAL` profile controlling strictness, fallback resilience, baseline handling rules, JSON status augmentation, and exit semantics. Unset `GOAL` defaults to `Streak` for backward compatibility (legacy single-mode behavior maps to today’s Streak).

| Dimension | Streak | Governance | Explore | CI |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|----|
| Intent | Rapid OK streak build (resilient) | Pre-enforcement strict validation | Developer sandbox (diagnostics) | Deterministic automation gating |
| Strictness | Phased: start `set -uo pipefail`; add `-e` before stats | Full `set -euo pipefail` | `set -uo pipefail` (no `-e`) | Full `set -euo pipefail` |
| Synthetic Fallback | Allowed | Disallowed | Allowed | Disallowed |
| Missing Metrics | Warn + continue (`partial`) | Hard fail | Warn + continue (`partial`) | Hard fail |
| Baseline Creation | Yes (auto if absent) | Yes (only if complete & real) | Yes | Yes |
| Partial Flag (`partial`) | May appear | Must NOT appear | May appear | Must NOT appear |
| Synthetic Flag (`synthetic_used`) | Present if fallback used | Must NOT appear | Present if used | Must NOT appear |
| Ephemeral Flag (`ephemeral`) | No | No | Yes | No |
| Exit on Missing | No | Yes | No (unless catastrophic) | Yes |
| Exit on Synthetic | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| JSON Always | `goal` | `goal` | `goal` | `goal` |

Internal flag mapping (derived after `apply_goal_profile` – documented, not user-facing):

```
streak:     ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=1 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=0 HARD_STRICT=0 STRICT_PHASED=1 SOFT_MISSING_OK=1 JSON_PARTIAL_OK=1 EPHEMERAL_FLAG=0
governance: ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=0 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=1 HARD_STRICT=1 STRICT_PHASED=0 SOFT_MISSING_OK=0 JSON_PARTIAL_OK=0 EPHEMERAL_FLAG=0
explore:    ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=1 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=0 HARD_STRICT=0 STRICT_PHASED=0 SOFT_MISSING_OK=1 JSON_PARTIAL_OK=1 EPHEMERAL_FLAG=1
ci:         ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=0 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=1 HARD_STRICT=1 STRICT_PHASED=0 SOFT_MISSING_OK=0 JSON_PARTIAL_OK=0 EPHEMERAL_FLAG=0
```

Pseudocode scaffold:

```
apply_goal_profile() {
  local g="${GOAL:-Streak}"
  g="${g:l}"
  ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=0 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=1 HARD_STRICT=1 STRICT_PHASED=0 \
  SOFT_MISSING_OK=0 JSON_PARTIAL_OK=0 EPHEMERAL_FLAG=0
  case "$g" in
    streak)
      ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=1 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=0 HARD_STRICT=0 STRICT_PHASED=1 \
      SOFT_MISSING_OK=1 JSON_PARTIAL_OK=1 ;;
    governance) ;;
    explore)
      ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS=1 REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS=0 HARD_STRICT=0 SOFT_MISSING_OK=1 \
      JSON_PARTIAL_OK=1 EPHEMERAL_FLAG=1 ;;
    ci) ;;
    *) g="streak";;
  esac
  export GOAL="$g" ALLOW_SYNTHETIC_SEGMENTS REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS HARD_STRICT STRICT_PHASED \
         SOFT_MISSING_OK JSON_PARTIAL_OK EPHEMERAL_FLAG
}
```

Missing metric handling (conceptual):

```
if [[ -z "${value:-}" ]]; then
  if (( REQUIRE_ALL_METRICS )); then
    zf::err "Metric '${metric}' missing (GOAL=${GOAL})"; MISSING_CRITICAL=1
  else
    zf::warn "Metric '${metric}' missing (tolerated; GOAL=${GOAL})"; PARTIAL_FLAG=1; continue
  fi
fi
```

Status JSON augmentation (new non-sensitive keys):

- `goal` (enum: `streak|governance|explore|ci`)
- `synthetic_used` (present only if synthetic fallback executed)
- `partial` (present only if tolerant profile had missing metrics)
- `ephemeral` (Explore only)

Governance activation precondition update:
- A8: Three consecutive `GOAL=Governance` runs with neither `synthetic_used` nor `partial` present.

Historical note:
Legacy classifier “observe” behavior (tolerant + synthetic) is now explicitly represented by `GOAL=Streak` (resilient) or `GOAL=Explore` (diagnostic), eliminating ambiguous implicit modes.

Rollout phases:
1. Docs (this section)
2. Scaffold parser & `goal` field (no behavior change)
3. Enforce synthetic gating & missing metric policy
4. Strictness layering
5. Emit conditional flags (`synthetic_used`, `partial`, `ephemeral`)
6. Test matrix (T-GOAL-01..06)
7. CI adoption (`GOAL=ci`)
8. Governance activation with A8

## Executive Summary

**Mission:** Refactor fragmented legacy ZSH configuration into a deterministic, test-driven, modular 19-file system with measurable performance improvements and comprehensive automation.

**Current State:**  
- Stage 3 completed (migration + stabilization baseline locked)  
- Stage 4 scaffolding initiated (feature registry, template, status command)  
- Unified test runner (`run-all-tests-v2.zsh`) fully adopted (legacy runner deprecated)  
- Performance baseline established (334ms, 1.9% variance) for delta gating in Stage 4  
- Compliance + policy headers embedded; drift detection active  
- Initial Feature Layer principles ratified (deterministic ordering, failure containment, opt-in/opt-out)  
- Proceeding with registry + contract test onboarding

**Key Metrics Achieved:**
- Performance: `334ms 1.9%` startup with micro-benchmark baseline `37-44µs`
- Governance: `guard: stable` status with comprehensive badge automation
- Structure: 8 pre-plugin + 11 post-plugin modules with 100% sentinel guards
- Automation: Nightly CI workflows maintaining badge freshness and drift detection
- Privacy & Telemetry: Structured telemetry flags opt-in (`ZSH_LOG_STRUCTURED`, `ZSH_PERF_JSON`); Privacy Appendix (privacy/PRIVACY_APPENDIX.md) documents minimal schema & governance

---

### 1.2 Recent Achievements (Part 08.19)

- Deferred dispatcher skeleton (postprompt trigger, one-shot, telemetry `DEFERRED id=… ms=… rc=…`)
- Dependency cycle edge-case test suite (unknown deps, disabled suppression, multi-level cycles, cycle broken by disabled node)
- Cycle detector enhancements (scope limiting, disabled filtering toggle)
- Logging namespace migration completed (underscore wrappers removed; homogeneity test enforced)
- Telemetry / deferred execution documentation expansion (§2.2)
- Performance baseline reaffirmed (334ms, 1.9% variance; no regression)
- Telemetry governance tests added (baseline presence: `test-classifier-baselines.zsh`; structured schema validation: `test-structured-telemetry-schema.zsh`) – enforce-mode activation pending 3× consecutive OK classifier runs
- README segment sync automation tool (`tools/sync-readme-segments.zsh`) ensures REFERENCE §5.3 canonical segment table parity in README (drift prevention)

### 1.3 Next Steps (Sprint 2 Focus)
1. Replace placeholder SEGMENT probes with real pre/plugin/post/prompt/deferred attribution
2. Activate structured telemetry stubs (`ZSH_LOG_STRUCTURED`, `ZSH_PERF_JSON`) with no-op emit paths
3. Introduce structured telemetry stubs (JSON sidecar opt-in flag)
4. Performance regression harness & classifier (warn >10%, fail >25% observe mode)
5. Add Performance Log classifier legend (OK/WARN/FAIL thresholds) & integrate harness output notation
6. Dependency graph export (`zf::deps::export` + DOT renderer)
7. Privacy appendix + redaction hooks before enabling richer structured telemetry
8. Telemetry governance: integrate baseline & schema tests as gated CI step (ENFORCE_BASELINES + schema validation) and prepare enforce-mode flip after 3 consecutive OK runs
9. README canonical segment sync: add CI check (`tools/sync-readme-segments.zsh --check`) to prevent drift between REFERENCE §5.3 and README

### 2.2 Telemetry, Timing & Deferred Execution (Stage 4 Enhancements)

This section documents the emerging Stage 4 execution / measurement pipeline: how startup timing, policy checksum emission, and post‑prompt (deferred) tasks interoperate without regressing interactive readiness.

#### Overview

| Component | Purpose | Emission Form | When Recorded | File / Hook |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| GUIDELINES_CHECKSUM | Policy integrity anchor | POLICY checksum=&lt;sha&gt; | Early pre‑plugin | `02-guidelines-checksum.zsh` |
| Segment Timings (placeholders now) | Budget label stabilization | `SEGMENT name=<label> ms=<int> phase=<phase>` | During guarded probes | Various phase stubs |
| Prompt Readiness Marker | Boundary for deferred dispatch eligibility | PROMPT_READY_MS env var | First successful `precmd` | `95-prompt-ready.zsh` |
| Deferred Dispatcher | Executes non-critical jobs post-first prompt | `DEFERRED id=<id> ms=<int> rc=<rc>` | First `precmd` after PROMPT_READY | `96-deferred-dispatch.zsh` |
| Dependency Cycle Scan (optional) | Safety net for module graph | `dependency-cycle:` errors (stderr) | On demand / test scope | `02-module-hardening.zsh` |
| Error / Severity Log | Structured fault surface (namespaced) | `[zf-error] ...` + optional PERF `ERROR level=...` | On each severity event | `01-error-handling-framework.zsh` |

#### Execution Phases (Simplified Timeline)

```
[zsh start]
  -> Pre-plugin modules
       - policy checksum export (POLICY line)
       - (future) early segment markers (pre_plugin_total)
  -> Plugin / post-plugin modules
       - placeholder sync segments
  -> Prompt instrumentation (95-prompt-ready) sets PROMPT_READY_MS
  -> First prompt rendered (interactive control handed to user)
  -> Deferred dispatcher (96-deferred-dispatch) runs queued jobs exactly once
       - Emits DEFERRED timing lines (phase=postprompt logical bucket)
```

#### Deferred Dispatcher (Skeleton – Current Scope)

| Aspect | Current Behavior | Roadmap |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Registration API | `zf::defer::register <id> <func> postprompt <desc>` | Additional triggers: idle, background-safe, network |
| Launch Condition | First `precmd` after `PROMPT_READY_MS` | Multi-trigger with prioritization |
| Overhead Target | ≤ ~1–2ms definition cost; zero pre-prompt runtime | Fine-grained attribution + budget gating |
| Telemetry | Per-job ms duration → PERF_SEGMENT_LOG (DEFERRED line) | Structured JSON stream |
| Isolation | Silent; logs to `${ZDOTDIR}/.logs/deferred.log` | Failure classification + retry/backoff policies |
| Non-interactive Guard | `$-` contains `i` required | Remote batch fallback queue (later) |

#### Telemetry & Performance Emission Formats (Current + Classifier Integration)

```
POLICY checksum=<sha256>
SEGMENT name=<label> ms=<int> phase=<phase> sample=<mode?>
DEFERRED id=<id> ms=<int> rc=<rc>
ERROR level=<LEVEL> module=<module>
```

The `SEGMENT` line family now underpins the multi-metric performance classifier.  
Structured JSON sidecar records (when `ZSH_LOG_STRUCTURED=1`) mirror each textual SEGMENT with keys:
`{"type":"segment","name":"<label>","ms":<int>,"phase":"<phase>","sample":"<context>","ts":<epoch_ms>}`

##### Canonical Segment Inventory (Sprint 2)

| Segment | Phase | Module | Purpose |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| pre_plugin_start | pre_plugin | 00-path-safety (pre) | Anchor (start reference) |
| pre_plugin_total | pre_plugin | 40-pre-plugin-reserved | Aggregate pre-plugin elapsed |
| post_plugin_total | post_plugin | 85-post-plugin-boundary / 90-splash | Aggregate functional post-plugin elapsed |
| prompt_ready | prompt | 95-prompt-ready | Time to first prompt (TTFP) |
| deferred_total | postprompt | 96-deferred-dispatch | Aggregated deferred batch |
| essential/zsh-syntax-highlighting | post_plugin | 20-essential-plugins | Plugin attribution |
| essential/zsh-autosuggestions | post_plugin | 20-essential-plugins | Plugin attribution |
| essential/zsh-completions | post_plugin | 20-essential-plugins | Plugin attribution |
| history/baseline | post_plugin | 50-completion-history | History & policy |
| safety/aliases | post_plugin | 40-aliases-keybindings | Alias setup |
| navigation/cd | post_plugin | 40-aliases-keybindings | Navigation helpers |
| dev-env/nvm | post_plugin | 30-development-env | Toolchain surfacing |
| dev-env/rbenv | post_plugin | 30-development-env | Toolchain surfacing |
| dev-env/pyenv | post_plugin | 30-development-env | Toolchain surfacing |
| dev-env/go | post_plugin | 30-development-env | Toolchain surfacing |
| dev-env/rust | post_plugin | 30-development-env | Toolchain surfacing |
| completion/history-setup | post_plugin | 50-completion-history | History initialization |
| completion/cache-scan | post_plugin | 50-completion-history | Compinit cache inspection |
| compinit | post_plugin | 55-compinit-instrument | Single guarded compinit |
| p10k_theme | post_plugin | 60-p10k-instrument | Prompt theme init |
| gitstatus_init | post_plugin | 65-vcs-gitstatus-instrument | Git status daemon |
| ui/prompt-setup | post_plugin | 60-ui-prompt | Prompt orchestration placeholder |
| security/validation | post_plugin | 80-security-validation | Integrity placeholder |

(Full authoritative table also maintained in REFERENCE §5.3.)

##### Disable Flags (Selective Suppression)

| Flag | Suppresses Segments | Default |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| ZSH_DISABLE_ALIASES_KEYBINDINGS=1 | safety/aliases, navigation/cd | Off |
| ZSH_DISABLE_UI_PROMPT_SEGMENT=1 | ui/prompt-setup | Off |
| ZSH_DISABLE_SECURITY_VALIDATION_SEGMENT=1 | security/validation | Off |

Disabling a segment does NOT disable its module sentinel; tests assert suppression behavior separately.

##### Multi-Metric Classifier Integration

Classifier script: `tools/perf-regression-classifier.zsh`

| Metric Key (JSON) | Derived From | Segment Basis | Typical Baseline | Warn / Fail Thresholds |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| pre_plugin_total_ms | Time between pre-plugin anchors | pre_plugin_total | ~45ms | 10% / 25% |
| post_plugin_total_ms | Functional post-plugin window | post_plugin_total | ~185ms | 10% / 25% |
| prompt_ready_ms | Startup to first prompt | prompt_ready | 334ms | 10% / 25% |
| deferred_total_ms | Deferred dispatcher batch | deferred_total | ~30ms | 10% / 25% (high slack) |

Overall status = worst (FAIL > WARN > OK/Base).  
First run per metric without an existing baseline ⇒ `BASELINE_CREATED` (green).

##### Baseline Integrity (Planned / Implemented)

| Aspect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Segment presence & format | `test-granular-segments.zsh` |
| Duplicate prevention | Same test (count == 1) |
| Disable flag suppression | Added section in granular segments test |
| Per-metric baseline existence | Future classifier baseline presence test |
| JSON key whitelist | Planned sanitation test (privacy enforcement) |

##### Policy to Add a New Segment

1. Justify attribution or governance necessity.  
2. Implement single guarded emission (no loops).  
3. Update REFERENCE §5.3 + this section.  
4. Extend granular segment & disable tests.  
5. Run classifier (observe mode) to confirm benign delta.  
6. Append PERFORMANCE_LOG entry if synchronous delta ≥1ms (otherwise note “+0”).  


(All appended to `$PERF_SEGMENT_LOG` when writable.)

#### Adding a New Deferred Job (Example)

```zsh
# Define the job
my__cache_warm_job() {
  # light, silent work here
  command -v git >/dev/null 2>&1 && git --version >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
}

# Register (postprompt trigger)
zf::defer::register "cache-warm" "my__cache_warm_job" "postprompt" "Light cache warm priming"
```

#### Design Invariants

1. No deferred job may emit user-facing output to stdout/stderr (logs only).
2. Dispatcher must not re-run (idempotent; guard `_ZSH_DEFERRED_DISPATCH_RAN`).
3. Pre-prompt critical path must remain < existing variance thresholds (currently ~334ms, 1.9% RSD).
4. Telemetry lines must remain parse-stable (regex compatibility with CI parsers).
5. Policy checksum must precede any deferred reference to ensure integrity context is available downstream.

#### Privacy & Scope

Current telemetry is local-only:
- No network transmission.
- Plaintext append to PERF segment log + optional local deferred log.
- Redaction not presently required; future structured mode will add redaction hooks before enabling richer content.

#### Testing Guidance

| Test Type | Focus | Example Assertion |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Design / Structure | One-shot dispatch | Log contains single DEFERRED id=dummy-warm |
| Performance | No added pre-plugin delta | Compare pre_plugin_total variance before/after |
| Dependency Edge Cases | Disabled / unknown / cycle resilience | Cycle absent when disabled node breaks chain |
| Namespace Homogeneity (logging) | Use of `zf::` API only | Grep ensures no stray `zf_warn` etc (excluding wrapper block) |

#### Future Enhancements (Planned)

- Idle time budgeted queue (increments after user keystrokes settle)
- Adaptive backoff for failed jobs (exponential with cap)
- Structured JSON ledger: `{"type":"deferred","id":"…","ms":12,"ts":...}`
- Optional export command: `zf::telemetry::export --format=jsonl`
- Telemetry gating flag: `ZSH_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` (placeholder design)
- Telemetry JSON key sanitation test (A): whitelist enforcement (planned CI gate) to fail on unexpected structured segment fields
- Per-metric baseline presence test (B): classifier guard to ensure each tracked metric has an up-to-date baseline before enforcing drift
- README cross-link automation (C): script to sync canonical segment & classifier table (REFERENCE §5.3 → README badges/legend)
- Structured telemetry schema validator script (D): `tools/test-structured-telemetry-schema.zsh` – denies unknown keys, emits diff of allowed vs observed

### 2.2 Key Design Principles

### 2.3 Feature Layer Architecture (Stage 4 Kickoff)

The Feature Layer introduces an opt-in, modular capability stack above the stabilized core. Its design enforces deterministic loading, failure containment, and measurable performance impact.

Core Components:
1. Feature Registry (`feature/registry/feature-registry.zsh`)
   - Stores metadata: phase, dependencies, category, deferred flag, GUID.
   - Provides add/list/resolve functions with cycle detection (topological sort).
   - Caches enablement decisions (per session) to minimize repeated dispatch cost.

2. Feature Module Contract (see `_TEMPLATE_FEATURE_MODULE.zsh`)
   - Required metadata variables (single-line for grep extraction).
   - Required functions (by naming convention):
     - `feature_<name>_metadata`
     - `feature_<name>_is_enabled`
     - `feature_<name>_register`
     - `feature_<name>_init` (primary activation point)
   - Optional: `preload`, `postprompt`, `teardown`, `self_check`, failure injection helper.

3. Enable / Disable Semantics (precedence order)
   - `ZSH_FEATURES_DISABLE` (supports `all`)
   - `ZSH_FEATURES_ENABLE`
   - Per-feature override: `ZSH_FEATURE_<UPPER_NAME>_ENABLED`
   - Fallback to `FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED`

4. Load Phases (planned)
   - Phase 1: Critical early UX scaffolding (minimal prompt base)
   - Phase 2: Standard interactive features (history, completion augmentation, keybindings)
   - Phase 3: Deferred / async (fzf integrations, telemetry, heavy scans)

5. Performance Guardrails
   - Baseline: 334ms cold start (Stage 3 reference)
   - Hard ceiling (early Stage 4): +15% (< ~384ms) – failing CI (planned enforcement gate)
   - Soft per-feature synchronous budget: 20ms (warn + defer recommendation)
   - Telemetry is opt-in to avoid skewing baseline; timing wrappers to be introduced after stable registry adoption.

6. Failure Containment Strategy
   - Each feature invocation (future implementation) wrapped in:
     - Timing capture (optional)
     - `set -e`–resilient boundary with non-zero exit logged but not fatal
   - A failing feature must not abort shell startup; registry resolution isolates dependency-related fallout.

7. Testing Additions (Stage 4)
   - Registry contract tests (present)
   - Enable/disable semantics tests (planned)
   - Dependency + cycle detection tests (present)
   - Failure containment + injected error path tests (planned)
   - Performance delta tests (planned once invocation wrapper added)
   - Deferred load validation (will follow postprompt hook integration)

8. Observability & Introspection
   - `feature-status.zsh` provides:
     - Table / raw / JSON output
     - Summary counts
     - Lightweight self-check
   - Future: per-feature timing & phase execution ledger (opt-in)

9. Compliance & Policy
   - Each module carries checksum-referenced compliance header.
   - Sensitive operations (PATH mutation, external process spawn) will cite exact guideline file + line references inline when introduced.

10. Planned Next Increments
   - Add invocation wrapper + timing
   - Implement noop demo feature (contract exemplar)
   - Add enable/disable + dependency edge-case test suite
   - Integrate performance delta harness extension
   - Author Feature Catalog + Developer Guide (tracked in Stage 4 kickoff doc)

This section will evolve as invocation and deferred scheduling mechanisms are implemented; all structural changes require synchronized updates to the Feature Catalog and Task Tracker.

1. **Deterministic Loading:** Sequential numbered modules with clear dependencies
2. **Sentinel Guards:** Every module protected against multiple sourcing
3. **Performance First:** Lazy loading, deferred heavy operations, instrumented hotspots
4. **Test-Driven:** Comprehensive test coverage across 6 categories
5. **Automated Governance:** CI-driven badge system with drift detection
6. **Rollback Ready:** Checksum validation and recovery mechanisms

- **Comprehensive automation** via CI workflows maintaining badge freshness
- **Performance optimization** achieving 334ms startup with micro-benchmark baseline
- **Quality assurance** through extensive test coverage and CI enforcement
- **Future-ready architecture** positioned for async activation and feature completion

### 10.2 Immediate Next Actions

3. **Maintain Automation:** Ensure nightly workflows continue badge refresh
4. **Plan Async Activation:** Prepare for async facility enablement
5. **Document Progress:** Keep implementation tracking current and accurate

### 10.2.1 Git-flow guidance and recommended branch workflow

To remain consistent with the project's use of Git Flow, follow this lightweight, explicit workflow for feature development, CI validation, and promotion to main production enforcement:

1. Work on a feature branch (naming convention: `feature/<short-desc>` or `hotfix/<short-desc>` for urgent fixes).
   - Example: `feature/zsh-refactor-configuration`
   - Keep commits focused and testable; run the integration runner and perf smoke locally before pushing.

2. Push the completed feature branch to the remote and open a Pull Request targeting `develop`.
   - PR base: `develop`
   - PR head: `feature/<name>`
   - Mark as Draft while still iterating; convert to Ready for review when stable.

3. Let CI validate the feature branch and `develop`:
   - Ensure the integration tests pass (compinit single-run, prompt single emission, monotonic lifecycle).
   - Confirm nightly ledger capture runs and that `develop` accumulates ledger snapshots (CI will create the real `perf-ledger-YYYYMMDD.json` files).
   - Use PR feedback loops to iterate until CI is consistently green.

4. Merge feature -> develop when:
   - Integration tests pass locally and in CI.
   - The feature's behavior is validated (no regressions, no structural breakage).
   - Any documentation changes (README / IMPLEMENTATION) are included.

5. Validate stability on `develop` for the 7-day gate:
   - Let CI produce daily ledger snapshots for seven consecutive nights in `docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/ledger-history/` (or store them as retained CI artifacts).
   - Ensure integration tests remain green across pushes to `develop`.
   - Collect and attach evidence (drift badge, `stage3-exit-report.json`, the last 7 ledger snapshots, microbench baseline) when preparing to flip enforcement.

6. Promote to main (separate PR):
   - Once the 7-day stability gate and CI validation are satisfied on `develop`, open a targeted PR to `main` that *enables* enforcement flags such as `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=1`.
   - This PR should include the evidence bundle and a clear rollback plan.

7. Rollback & remediation:
   - If a regression appears after enabling enforcement, open a remediation PR to revert the enforcement change and include instructions to temporarily set `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=0` (or revert the main PR).
   - Add temporary observability toggles (increase `stable_run_count`, set `VARIANCE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`) while investigating.

Rationale and benefits
- Keeps feature development isolated and reviewable.
- Ensures `develop` is the CI-validated staging area where the 7-day ledger history accumulates.
- Keeps the `main` branch reserved for production enforcement changes that should only be made after provable stability.
- Enables a clear, auditable roll-forward / roll-back plan for enforcement toggles.

Notes on seeded ledger snapshots and CI-generated artifacts
- Seeded snapshots in `docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/ledger-history/` are acceptable for local testing and documentation, but CI should be the source of truth for the 7-day stability gate.
- Recommendation:
  - Keep only explicit, small "seed" snapshots committed (clearly labeled as seeds) for developer onboarding and quick validation.
  - Do NOT commit CI-generated daily ledgers produced by the nightly job; instead:
    - Either retain them as CI artifacts that can be downloaded for evidence, or
    - Provide an automated process (script in CI) that, upon stable collection of 7 days, bundles evidence into a release branch or an artifacts location for PR attachment.
- Update README and IMPLEMENTATION to clarify that:
  - Seeds are for local validation only and are not the canonical ledger history.
  - CI is responsible for writing the authoritative ledger snapshots used for the 7-day gate and enforcement decision.

How this affects documentation
- `dot-config/zsh/docs/redesignv2/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  - Add and maintain the Git-flow guidance and the ledger snapshot policy (this section).
  - Clarify the roles of `develop` (staging/validation) vs `main` (production enforcement) in the promotion process.

- `dot-config/zsh/docs/redesignv2/README.md`
  - Add a short note explaining the ledger snapshot policy:
    - Seed snapshots are included for examples/testing.
    - The CI nightly job produces authoritative daily ledgers and should be used when preparing enforcement PRs.
  - Point to the Git-flow guidance maintained in `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for the branch/PR process.

Adopting this Git-flow guidance will keep promotion decisions auditable and minimize surprise enforcement flips on `main`. Follow the checklist above before enabling strict enforcement on `main`.

## Fast-track: In-branch activation & full redesign task list

Goal: implement and activate the complete redesign in this feature branch (opt-in via feature flag), then iterate QA and testing until ready to merge to `develop`. Activation default: feature-flag protected (`ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=1`) and fail‑soft behavior for regressions.

Activation summary
- Activation mode: opt-in via environment variable `ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=1` (default off).
- Target: run redesign locally (interactive) and in dedicated CI job(s) in this branch only.
- Rollback: fail-soft by default; emergency toggle `ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=0` or CI env `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=0` for rapid disable.

Notes:
- All tasks are owned by `s-a-c` by default (you can assign others later).
- ETA times are conservative estimates; parallelization will reduce calendar time.
- Priority labeling: all above are P0 for the fast-track (must complete before enabling redesign broadly).

Activation checklist (quick)
1. Enable redesign locally:
   - Backup current config: `tools/migrate-to-redesign.sh --backup`
   - Enable redesign: `export ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=1`
   - Start a clean shell: `env -i ZDOTDIR=$PWD /bin/zsh -i -f`
2. Run local smoke tests:
   - `./dot-config/zsh/tests/run-integration-tests.sh --timeout-secs 30 --verbose`
   - `./dot-config/zsh/tools/perf-capture-multi.zsh -n 1 --no-segments --quiet`
3. If issues arise, disable: `export ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=0` and `tools/migrate-to-redesign.sh --restore`
4. For CI, run the branch-only redesign job with `ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=1` and observe artifacts and logs.

Emergency rollback commands
- Disable redesign in your session: `export ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=0`
- Restore previous dotfiles snapshot (created by migration script):
  - `tools/migrate-to-redesign.sh --restore`
- If enforcement flips accidentally in CI, create remediation PR using `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and set `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=0` until triage completes.

QA plan in-branch (summary)
- Use opt-in flag to exercise redesign locally and in branch CI.
- Keep all enforcement disabled (fail-soft): `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION` remains `0` in branch CI.
- Run nightly branch CI that uploads ledger artifacts (retention >= 7 days) and use `bundle-ledgers.yml` to create an evidence zip.
- Iterate on modules and tests until all QA and perf tests are green in branch CI for an observation window (recommended: 7 days).
- After signoff, prepare the develop-targeted PR that migrates the code from being branch-only to the mainline (per Git-flow).

Security & safety notes
- The redesign will be behind `ZSH_USE_REDESIGN` by default. Only enable for your local shells or in branch CI runs for testing.
- Keep `.gitignore` entries and commit-check workflows to avoid accidentally committing CI-generated ledger files.
- Keep remediation PR template and owners informed for fast rollback.

If you want me to proceed now, I will:
- Implement the feature-flag scaffolding (`FT-01`), migration helper (`FT-10`), and skeleton module files for 40/50/60 (`FT-02`, `FT-03`, `FT-04`) in this branch and push them.
- After that I will run local integration & perf smoke checks and report results. (You asked for sprint/today timing; I will start immediately if you confirm.)


### 10.3 Long-term Vision

The redesigned ZSH configuration will deliver:
- **Predictable Performance:** Sub-300ms startup with <5% variance
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Real-time performance and health tracking
- **Automated Quality:** CI-driven testing and validation at every change
- **Future Flexibility:** Modular architecture supporting ongoing evolution
- **Operational Excellence:** Complete tooling for maintenance and troubleshooting

This implementation represents a foundation for long-term ZSH configuration excellence, balancing performance, maintainability, and feature richness in a sustainable, automated framework.

## Stage 3 Exit: Implementation Updates

Summary of actions completed for Stage 3 exit:
- Added robust per-sample watchdog and retry logic to `tools/perf-capture-multi.zsh` (F49). This ensures authentic multi-sample captures and rejects synthetic cloning of results.
- Automated badge refresh: `tools/update-variance-and-badges.zsh` now consumes `perf-multi-simple.json` and updates `variance-gating-state.json`, governance badge, and perf badge.
- Drift readiness helper `tools/prepare-drift-guard-flip.zsh` updated to prefer the repo-level metrics path and fallback to the dot-config path; corrected repo-root resolution.
- Seeded `docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/ledger-history/` for readiness verification (CI should populate this directory nightly for real historical evaluation).
- Added a robust local test framework at `dot-config/zsh/tests/lib/test-framework.zsh` to let integration tests run in minimal CI and dev environments; integration tests were run locally and the prompt single emission test now passes.

Implications for Stage 4:
- The monitoring, gating, and enforcement infrastructure is in place. After a successful 7-day CI-driven stability window and passing async activation checklist in CI, the team may flip the drift guard to enforcement (fail on >10% regressions).

Operational notes:
- Default enforcement remains disabled; do not enable `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=1` until a 7-day stable ledger history exists and CI tests pass consistently.
- The `perf-capture-multi.zsh` default retry and watchdog parameters can be tuned for CI latency.
