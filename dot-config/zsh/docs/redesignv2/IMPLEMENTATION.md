# ZSH Configuration Redesign ‚Äì Consolidated Implementation Guide
Version: 2.3  
Status: Stage 2 Complete ‚Äì Stage 3 In Progress (core hardening, trust anchors, micro-benchmark harness, drift tooling)  
Last Updated: 2025-09-04 (Added micro-benchmark harness stabilization, variance log integration, perf drift badge script, trust anchor read APIs)
Compliant with [/Users/s-a-c/dotfiles/dot-config/ai/guidelines.md](/Users/s-a-c/dotfiles/dot-config/ai/guidelines.md) v50b6b88e7dea25311b5e28879c90b857ba9f1c4b0bc974a72f6b14bc68d54f49

NOTE (Early Instrumentation Pull-Forward):
Two helper modules (`01-segment-lib-bootstrap.zsh`, `02-guidelines-checksum.zsh`) reside in the pre-plugin directory to enable early segmentation & policy checksum export. They are NOT counted toward the stable ‚Äú8 pre-plugin + 11 post-plugin‚Äù architectural budget and may be merged or repositioned during Stage 5.

This document *replaces and consolidates* the prior `master-plan.md`, `implementation-plan.md`, `final-report.md`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`. It is the authoritative reference for execution, progress tracking, and promotion readiness of the redesign effort. New in v2.2: path resolution enforcement (badge + fail-fast), strict mode (--strict) for advanced audits, helper verification tool, and proactive future plugin path guard test.

## 0. Executive Summary

The ZSH configuration is being refactored from a fragmented legacy layout (dozens of loosely ordered files) into a deterministic, test-driven, **modular 19-file system**:
- **Pre-plugin phase (8 files)**: Prepare environment, defer heavy work, establish lazy frameworks.
- **Post-plugin phase (11 files)**: Functional layering (security ‚Üí options ‚Üí runtime ‚Üí completion ‚Üí UI ‚Üí performance ‚Üí async validation ‚Üí cosmetic).

Primary measurable targets:

| Objective | Baseline | Target | Evidence Source | Gate |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------|------|
| Startup mean (ms) | 4772ms | ‚â§3817ms (‚â•20% reduction) | `artifacts/metrics/perf-baseline.json`, `perf-current.json` | Promotion |
| Pre-plugin consolidation | 12 legacy fragments | 8 modules | Inventory diff | Stage 2 exit |
| Post-plugin consolidation | >25 active/latent | 11 modules | Structure audit | Stage 5 exit |
| Compinit executions | >1 risk | Exactly 1 | Compinit tests | Stage 5 exit |
| Deferred security hashing | Blocking at startup | Fully post-first prompt | Async logs & tests | Stage 6 gate |
| Regression control | None | ‚â§5% allowed | perf regression tests | Ongoing |
| Sentinel discipline | Inconsistent guards | 100% modules guarded | Sentinel test | Stage 3+ ongoing |
| Documentation drift | Ad-hoc | Consolidated, versioned | Lint & index | Ongoing |

### 1.1 Instrumentation Snapshot (Early Stage 5 Pulled Forward)

Currently emitted (mean sample) segment labels (from `perf-current-segments.txt` / observe mode):
- Core lifecycle: `pre_plugin_total`, `post_plugin_total`, `prompt_ready`
- Hotspot instrumentation: `compinit`, `p10k_theme` (theme sourcing)
- Plugin manager / post-plugin scaffolding: `zgenom-init` (if present)
- Layered module markers (coarse still visible via post-plugin breakdown): `20-essential`, `30-dev-env`, `50-completion-history`
- Policy / governance marker: `policy_guidelines_checksum` (meta, appears when checksum exported)
- Planned / conditional (instrumented but may not always appear): `gitstatus_init` (module `65-vcs-gitstatus-instrument.zsh`, segment shown only when gitstatus plugin detected)

Coverage Status:
- Minimum required high-level trio (pre, post, prompt) present ‚úÖ
- Critical hotspot segments (compinit, p10k_theme) present ‚úÖ
- VCS status segment instrumentation implemented (file present) but not yet observed in baseline sample (likely plugin path not detected) ‚ö†Ô∏è (informational)
- Guidelines checksum marker present in segment file when checksum environment exported (ensures policy correlation)

Next Additions (planned instrumentation expansion):
- `gitstatus_init` (ensure plugin path resolution test)
- Additional heavy plugin groups (syntax highlighting, history backend) once identified
- Async security scan scheduling markers (post prompt) in later Stage 5/6 work

This snapshot will be updated when new hotspot segments are added or when observe ‚Üí warn/gate mode transitions occur.

---

### 1.2 Next Implementation Tasks (Rolling 7-Day Plan)

(Time horizon: next 7 calendar days; reassess / slide window forward after completion or blockage. Priorities: P1 = must land to unblock downstream stages; P2 = should land (stability / signal quality); P3 = opportunistic / hardening.)

P0 Immediate Perf & Bench (New)
- Capture first micro-benchmark baseline (`bench-core-functions.zsh --json --iterations 5000 --repeat 3 > docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/bench-core-baseline.json`) and commit artifact (observational; shimmed_count noted).
- Integrate `perf-drift-badge.sh` in CI (publish `docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/perf-drift.json`) + add drift badge presence test (warn mode initial).
- Force a fresh multi-sample perf run: `PERF_CAPTURE_FORCE=1 tools/perf-capture-multi.zsh --samples 5 --sleep 0.3` once instrumentation is expected to emit non‚Äëzero `post_plugin_total` & `prompt_ready_ms`.
- Monotonic validation: immediately run `tools/promotion-guard.zsh 11 --allow-mismatch` (or inspect CI promotion guard log) and confirm `monotonic=ok`. If `monotonic=warn(...)` appears, investigate ordering (check segment emission timing / late prompt hook) before proceeding.
- Cache bypass fallback: if run skips due to fingerprint cache, delete `docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/perf-multi-fingerprint.txt` (if present) or re‚Äëinvoke with `PERF_CAPTURE_FORCE=1` again, then re-run capture.
- Variance Stability Log: append a new row with non‚Äëzero trio (pre/post/prompt) including mean, stddev, RSD. If this is the 2nd consecutive low‚ÄëRSD (<5%) run for pre & post segments, set decision for pre_plugin_cost_ms to `enable_warn` candidate (do not flip gating env yet if post/prompt just stabilized).
- If `post_plugin_total` or `prompt_ready_ms` still zero: enable debug (`PERF_CAPTURE_DEBUG=1`) and defer log decision (note ‚Äúhold ‚Äì missing segment‚Äù).
- Record monotonic status + sample count context in governance follow-up notes (will surface once variance-state & governance weighting tasks (F28/F27) proceed).

P1 Core Module Hardening
- 00-security-integrity.zsh: Add minimal PATH hygiene verification helper (zf::path_append_secure self-test) and expose trust anchor read API (read-only) for future hashing.
- 05-interactive-options.zsh: Lock golden snapshot hash (capture & log in test output) and prepare diff formatter for intentional changes.
- 10-core-functions.zsh: Add lightweight micro-benchmark harness (optional) for timing helpers (<1ms target) and begin draft of future fingerprint drift test (informational only).
- Sentinel & idempotency design test: Extend to assert no growth in deferred tasks map beyond security_integrity_check (prevents silent accumulation).

P1 Performance & Gating
- Variance streak: Achieve REQUIRED_STABLE threshold (‚â•2 consecutive stable runs) ‚Äî if already met, flip PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=1 (main only) via recommender output adoption.
- Perf ledger: Capture at least 2 nightly history snapshots with non-zero post_plugin_total prior to tightening budgets.
- Drift badge: Add threshold annotation (message suffix ‚Äú(+X% max)‚Äù when any WARN) for faster PR scanning.

P1 Testing & Quality
- Add failure classification mapping for perf-ledger-drift (regression tiers: >5% warn, >10% fail) coordinated with budget script messaging (align color taxonomy).
- Introduce manifest test WARN mode in CI for first 48h (allow stabilization), then flip to strict (set CORE_FN_MANIFEST_WARN_ONLY=0 on main).

P2 Documentation & Governance
- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Introduce ‚ÄúVariance Stability Log‚Äù subsection (append entries: date, sample count, variance %, decision).
- Add README badge row: perf drift, perf ledger, variance decision (observe/warn/gate).
- Prepare Stage 3 readiness checklist file (stages/stage-3-core.md) mirroring exit criteria for quicker PR references.

P2 CI & Automation
- Integrate auto-enable-perf-warn-gate.zsh into nightly ledger workflow (optional dry-run mode) for cross-validation of daytime variance vs nightly variance.
- Add perf-drift.json & perf-ledger.json ingestion into infra-health generator once stability proven (currently perf-ledger is integrated; drift waits for one stabilized week to avoid noise).

### 1.3 Variance Stability Log (Rolling)

Purpose: Trace empirical variance characteristics (multi‚Äësample runs) that drive observe ‚Üí warn ‚Üí gate transitions for performance regression enforcement. Updated only when a new qualifying multi-sample capture (or gating decision) occurs.

Schema (columns):
| Date (UTC) | Samples (N) | Metric | Mean (ms) | Stddev (ms) | RSD (stddev/mean) | Decision | Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|-------|

Decision values: observe (collect only), candidate (meets stability thresholds but awaiting confirmation run), enable_warn (flip warn mode), enable_fail (flip hard gating), hold (variance too high), pending (insufficient data).

Initial Entries:

| Date (UTC) | Samples (N) | Metric | Mean (ms) | Stddev (ms) | RSD | Decision | Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|-----|----------|-------|
| 2025-09-04 | 5 | pre_plugin_cost_ms | 80‚Äì85 (aggregate mean artifact reports 85) | ~2‚Äì3 (raw value spread 79‚Äì85) | ~0.03 | candidate | Low variance; artifact aggregation rounding needs sanity check (mean vs listed values). |
| 2025-09-04 | 5 | post_plugin_cost_ms | 0 (placeholder) | 0 | 0 | hold | Segment not yet captured in multi-sample (instrumentation / capture path pending). |
| 2025-09-04 | 5 | prompt_ready_ms | 0 (placeholder) | 0 | 0 | hold | Prompt readiness marker not yet emitted in multi-sample capture. |
| 2025-09-04 | n/a | governance_integration | n/a | n/a | n/a | observe | Governance badge integrated (extended + simple); schedule forced multi-sample run (PERF_CAPTURE_FORCE=1) to refresh non-zero post_plugin_total & prompt_ready_ms and qualify pre_plugin_cost_ms for enable_warn transition once monotonic=ok confirmed. |

Next Actions (related to stability):
- Re-run multi-sample after ensuring post_plugin_total and prompt_ready markers are emitted (expect non-zero values).
- If a second consecutive low-RSD (<5%) run with valid post_plugin_total occurs, promote decision for pre_plugin_cost_ms to enable_warn (gating env PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION still off until post_plugin_total also stable).
- Add automated extraction of max positive regression to drift badge once non-zero segments stabilized (ties into P1 drift badge enhancement).

Trigger to Update This Log:
- Any multi-sample capture producing non-zero post_plugin_total + prompt_ready_ms.
- Variance recommender output transitions (candidate ‚Üí enable_warn / enable_fail).
- Introduction of additional metrics (e.g., interactive_ready_ms) once captured.

(End 1.3)
- Add caching for multi-sample captures (store last multi-current fingerprint to skip redundant run if unchanged environment).

P2 Risk / Watchlist
- Risk: Function namespace expansion without manifest update ‚Üí Mitigation: enforce manifest test strict after warm-up.
- Risk: Over-aggressive gating causing false negatives on macOS variance spikes ‚Üí Mitigation: collect at least 2 weekend samples before enabling fail mode.
- Risk: PATH hygiene regression via external contributions ‚Üí Mitigation: extend path append invariant test to detect mid-PATH insertions (not just deletions/order changes).

P3 Enhancements / Optional
- Prototype structured JSON emission for test-perf-ledger-drift (machine-readable for promotion guard).
- Add rolling median & MAD calculation to variance recommender (foundation for adaptive gating).
- Add SVG gradient variant for perf drift badge (visual emphasis for WARN vs FAIL).

Blocked / External Dependencies
- None currently blocking P1 items; gating enablement depends on natural variance stabilization (monitor over next 2 multi-sample runs).
- Awaiting first non-zero post_plugin_total snapshots in perf ledger (ensure plugin path conditions satisfied in capture harness).

Exit Signals to Reassess Plan
- PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION flipped to 1 on main.
- Two consecutive nightly perf-ledger snapshots with identical overBudgetCount=0.
- Core functions manifest stabilized (no additions for 3 days).

Ownership / Action Cues
- Core module refinements: same PR can batch 00/05/10 minor internal additions if tests updated atomically.
- Performance gating toggle: separate PR (small, easily revertible) once recommender JSON decision == enable_fail.

Metrics to Track This Week
- Variance % (post_plugin_total, prompt_ready)
- Drift counts (warn / fail) per PR
- OverBudgetCount trend (expect stable zero at current soft budgets)
- Core function count & manifest diff frequency (target: no unintentional changes)

(End Section 1.2)

## 2. Architecture & Stage Roadmap

### 2.1 Stage Overview (End-to-End)

| Stage | Label Tag | Scope | Exit Conditions | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | `refactor-stage1-complete` | Skeletons, tests, tooling, CI, verification | All infra tests PASS & tag created | ‚úÖ Done |
| 2 | `refactor-stage2-preplugin` | Implement pre-plugin 00‚Äì30 content | Path safety, lazy framework, node stubs, integrations, ssh-agent; baseline captured & tag pushed | ‚úÖ Complete |

| 4 | `refactor-stage4-features` | Post 20/30/40 feature layers | Plugin config, dev env exports, aliases/keybindings stable | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 5 | `refactor-stage5-ui-perf` | Post 50/60/70/80/90 (completion, UI, perf, async, splash) | Single compinit PASS, async queued & non-blocking | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 6 | `refactor-stage6-promotion-ready` | A/B validation + gates | All metrics & security gates PASS, promotion guard PASS | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 7 | `refactor-promotion-complete` | Toggle enable + checksum snapshot + archive legacy | New checksums + legacy archived + docs updated | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 8* | `refactor-cleanup` | (Optional) Drift test retirement, doc pruning | Lean stable footprint | ‚è≥ Optional |

*Stage 8 is optional hardening/cleanup after adoption.

### 2.2 Module Sequencing Logic
1. **Early path stability** ensures subsequent modules assume normalized environment.
2. **Lazy mechanics before heavy runtimes** (Node, direnv) prevents unnecessary early cost.
3. **Security integrity (light) precedes functional augmentation** but defers heavy hashing.
4. **Completion & prompt unify late** to guarantee single compinit and stable UI.
5. **Performance capture & async scanning** near end to avoid polluting early timing.

---

## 3. Detailed Stage Execution

### 3.1 Stage 1 (Completed) ‚Äì Foundation
Delivered:
- Inventories & checksum freeze.
- Redesign skeleton directories (guards + ordering).
- Sentinel audit & structure tests.
- Segment-aware perf capture tool.
- Async state test scaffolding.
- Promotion guard (structure + perf + checksum + async precondition logic).
- Central verification script.

Artifacts:
- Tag: `refactor-stage1-complete`
- Metrics: `artifacts/metrics/perf-baseline.json`
- Structure: `artifacts/metrics/structure-audit.json`

### 3.2 Stage 2 (Completed) ‚Äì Pre-Plugin Content Migration
> Note: `lazy_register` now supports a `--force` flag (added in Stage 2 enhancement) allowing forced lazy wrapping of already-present binaries (e.g. `direnv`, `gh`) to ensure consistent first-call instrumentation and loader state tracking. This capability is exercised in `25-lazy-integrations.zsh` to unify behavior and simplify future performance / correctness tests.

Scope Achieved (00‚Äì30):
- 00-path-safety.zsh (enhanced invariants I1‚ÄìI8; tests green)
- 05-fzf-init.zsh (no-compinit guarantee verified)
- 10-lazy-framework.zsh (registry, recursion guard, negative path coverage)
- 15-node-runtime-env.zsh (lazy nvm/npm detection chain, no early heavy sourcing)
- 20-macos-defaults-deferred.zsh (scheduling skeleton ‚Äì real async hook deferred to Stage 5)
- 25-lazy-integrations.zsh (direnv / gh / git config stubs ‚Äì richer lazy_register integration deferred)
- 30-ssh-agent.zsh (idempotent consolidation; spawn/reuse tests)
- Early instrumentation helpers (pulled forward, excluded from canonical count): 01-segment-lib-bootstrap.zsh, 02-guidelines-checksum.zsh

Task Status:
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Path normalization merge & tests | ‚úÖ | Invariants enforced |
| FZF lightweight init (no compinit) | ‚úÖ | Sentinel checks pass |
| Lazy framework production dispatcher | ‚úÖ | Negative & recursion tests |
| Node env lazy stubs | ‚úÖ | Detection + first-use path |
| macOS defaults deferral enhanced | ‚úÖ | Post-prompt hook registered (deferred async scheduling skeleton) |
| Lazy integrations enhanced | ‚úÖ | lazy_register + fallback wrappers (direnv/gh) landed |
| SSH agent consolidation | ‚úÖ | Single spawn/reuse invariant |
| Early instrumentation bootstrap | ‚úÖ | Observe mode only |
| Preplugin baseline capture (`preplugin-baseline.json`) | ‚úÖ | Captured (mean=35ms N=5 tag=refactor-stage2-preplugin) |
| Stage tag creation (`refactor-stage2-preplugin`) | ‚úÖ | Tag pushed & baseline locked |

Stage 2 Completion Summary:
- All pre-plugin modules (00‚Äì30) implemented with enhanced invariants, lazy integration wrappers, and ssh-agent idempotency.
- Baseline captured: mean=35ms, stdev=11ms, N=5 (artifact: `preplugin-baseline.json`).
- Tag `refactor-stage2-preplugin` pushed; baseline locked for regression guards.
- Instrumentation helpers (01/02) functioning in observe mode; excluded from canonical module count.
- Documentation and task ledger synchronized; Stage 2 exit criteria fully satisfied.

Post-Completion Notes (Deferred / Follow-ups):
- Regression guard tightened: pre-plugin allowed threshold reduced from +10% to +7%; target +5% after at least one additional low-variance (stdev/mean <5%) multi-sample set.
- Deferred async macOS defaults scheduling (will activate in Stage 5 with post-prompt hook refinement).
- Expand `lazy_register` richer integration behaviors (Stage 4/5).
- Integrate pre-plugin cost assertion directly into perf guard once guard tightening decision made.
- PATH append fix for test harness: ensure `.zshenv` appends (never overwrites) PATH in subshell contexts to guarantee availability of `awk`, `date`, `mkdir` during segment emission (schedule early Stage 3 if not already applied).

Deferred to Later Stages:
- Attach post-first-prompt async scheduling for macOS defaults (Stage 5).
- Convert integration stubs to `lazy_register` loaders + add corresponding state transition tests (Stage 4/5).
- Integrate pre-plugin cost assertion into perf guard once baseline committed.

Success Metrics (when baseline captured):
| Aspect | Gate |
|--------|------|
| Pre-plugin run cost | ‚â§ legacy pre-plugin baseline (target -10%) |
| Lazy framework calls | First invocation loads; subsequent constant |
| Path normalization | No duplicate logical dirs; tests green |
| Agent duplication | 0 spurious spawns with existing valid socket |

### Stage 3 Immediate Task List (Core Modules Bootstrap)

Execution Order (initial pass):
1. PATH append fix validation  
   - Confirm `.zshenv` only appends (never overwrites) PATH and preserves required core tool availability (`awk`, `date`, `mkdir`) in subshells.  
   - Add explicit test if not already covered.
2. Implement `00-security-integrity.zsh` (skeleton)  
   - Path hygiene enforcement (append semantics, no destructive rewrites)  
   - Export minimal trust anchor / checksum map reference (no hashing yet)  
   - Register integrity scheduler stub (deferred execution only)  
   - Idempotent sentinel + re-source test.
3. Implement `05-interactive-options.zsh`  
   - Consolidate `setopt` / `unsetopt`, history settings, base completion zstyles  
   - Ensure re-source produces zero diff snapshot (option snapshot test)  
   - Add sentinel guard + option snapshot golden file.
4. Implement `10-core-functions.zsh`  
   - Namespace: `zf::ensure_cmd`, `zf::log` (lightweight), `zf::warn`, minimal timing helper wrappers or adapters to segment-lib (no duplication)  
   - Add assertion utility (e.g. `zf::require`) for internal guards.  
   - Function namespace uniqueness + checksum/hash test.
5. Tests to Add / Finalize  
   - Path append invariant test (pre/post load diff)  
   - Option snapshot diff test (zero unintended changes)  
   - Function namespace uniqueness & idempotency test  
   - Core function count threshold test (CORE_FN_MIN_EXPECT; optional CORE_FN_GOLDEN_COUNT with CORE_FN_ALLOW_GROWTH)  
   - Golden option snapshot enforcement test (compare against `docs/redesignv2/artifacts/golden/options-snapshot-stage3-initial.txt`)  
   - Integrity scheduler single-registration test (no duplicate queue)  
   - Sentinel & idempotency design test (00 / 05 / 10 trio: sentinels, PATH non‚Äëshrink, stable snapshots)  
   - Perf ledger drift comparison test (current vs latest history snapshot)  
   - Core functions manifest name-level drift test (golden manifest)  
   - Perf variance gating recommender (auto-enable-perf-warn-gate.zsh) stability streak logic & state file + integrated env handoff to perf-diff (conditional fail)  
   - Perf drift badge generation (perf-drift.json ‚Üí SVG) surfaced in perf segments workflow & badges summary  
   - Helper availability test may call `tools/verify-path-helpers.zsh --assert both`.  
   - (Future) Enhanced perf ledger budget regression gate + infra-health badge aggregation verification (activate once variance <5% over ‚â•2 runs).
6. CI Enhancements  
   - Add non-fatal (observe) job step invoking `verify-path-helpers.zsh --assert any --json`; escalate to `--assert both` once both helpers guaranteed by Stage 3 mid-point.  
   - Introduce experimental perf module ledger capture (observe mode, nightly + PR):  
     `tools/experimental/perf-module-ledger.zsh --segments docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/perf-current-segments.txt --output docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/perf-ledger.json --budget post_plugin_total:3000,pre_plugin_total:120 --badge docs/badges/perf-ledger.json || true`  
   - Include `perf-ledger.json` + `perf-ledger` badge in existing badge summary aggregation (non-fatal).  
   - Gate escalation plan: once variance stable (<5%) and budgets tuned, enable `--fail-on-over` on main only.  
   - (Optional) Dry-run provisional post-plugin early cost ledger JSON (no gating yet).
7. Performance Guard Adjustments  
   - Collect two additional multi-sample runs (variance <5%) ‚Üí tighten regression guard from +7% to +5%.  
   - Begin capturing early post-plugin partial cost ledger for impending budget planning (ledger artifact becomes historical comparator).  
   - Track over-budget counts trend (ledger `overall.overBudgetCount`) in badge summary for future automated gating signal.
8. Documentation / Reporting  
   - Update README Stage Progress (Post-Plugin Core % as each of 00 / 05 / 10 lands).  
   - Create / refine `stages/stage-3-core.md` with a live checklist mirroring this task list.  
   - Add ledger integration status row to Section 1 snapshot once first successful CI artifact exists (State: "Perf Ledger Prototype ‚úÖ / Observe").  
   - Append Stage 3 readiness checklist to CONTRIBUTOR or implementation artifacts if not already enumerated.
9. Exit Criteria Preparation (Stage 3)  
   - [ ] PATH append invariant PASS  
   - [ ] Security skeleton idempotent  
   - [ ] Option snapshot stable (no drift)  
   - [ ] Core function namespace stable (checksum or count)  
   - [ ] Integrity scheduler registered exactly once  
   - [ ] Pre-plugin + early post-plugin perf within provisional budget (+‚â§5‚Äì8ms allowance)  
   - [ ] Tests added & green
10. Deferral Log (to Stage 4/5)  
   - Deep integrity hashing (Stage 5/6)  
   - Prompt / UI theming (Stage 5)  
   - Async execution activation beyond shadow mode (Stage 5+)  
   - Full segment budget hard gating (Stage 5/6)

Definitions of Done (Stage 3):
- Each new core module loads idempotently (re-source test passes, no side-effects on second load).
- Option snapshot diff returns empty (or only approved stable whitelist lines).
- All new functions reside in `zf::` namespace with no collisions or leakage into global space.
- Integrity scheduler stub presence verified; no execution prior to designated asynchronous activation stage.
- Path enforcement + helper verification both green in CI.

---

### 3.3 Stage 3 ‚Äì Post-Plugin Core

Scope (Initial Focus Modules):
- `00-security-integrity.zsh`
  - Responsibilities: environment/path hygiene (enforce append-not-overwrite rule), shell option hardening, integrity scan scheduler stub (registration only), trust anchor / checksum map reference.
  - Success Metrics: sanitized PATH preserved post-load; integrity scheduler registered exactly once; zero duplicate hardening operations on re-source.
- `05-interactive-options.zsh`
  - Consolidate `setopt` / `unsetopt`, `zstyle`, history & completion base semantics.
  - Idempotent re-sourcing (sentinel var + diff test).
  - Success Metrics: option snapshot diff = empty; history settings canonical; no unintended env mutations.
- `10-core-functions.zsh`
  - Namespaced helpers (prefix `zf::`) for: safe command presence (`zf::ensure_cmd`), lightweight logging, timing primitive (potential future unification with segment timing), small assertion utilities.
  - Success Metrics: function namespace uniqueness test passes; per-helper overhead ‚â§1ms (microbench harness).

Non-Goals (Explicit Deferrals):
- Plugin load / feature plugins (Stage 4).
- Async completion / prompt finalization (Stage 5).
- Deep integrity scan execution & promotion gating (Stage 6).
- UI/prompt theming (Stage 5).

Planned Tests & Gates:
- PATH hygiene test (append semantics preserved; no destructive overwrite) ‚Äì includes verification supporting the PATH append fix task.
- Re-source idempotency tests for each Stage 3 module.
- Option state snapshot: pre vs post module load; golden diff must be approved & stable.
- Function namespace collision & checksum stability test.
- Integrity scheduler single-registration assertion.

Performance Strategy (Stage 3):
- Provisional allowance: +5‚Äì8ms over locked pre-plugin baseline before plugins introduced.
- Maintain current +7% regression guard; plan tightening to +5% after 1‚Äì2 additional low-variance sample sets (stdev/mean <5%).  
- Dashboard Note (Stage 3): Pre-plugin guard now 7% (yellow band); next tightening gate = additional stable capture set.
- (Deferred) Module cost ledger JSON (target activation early Stage 4 when plugin costs begin).

Documentation / Ledger Updates:
- Add Stage 3 readiness checklist mirroring Stage 2 pattern:
  - [ ] PATH append fix confirmed (or implemented)
  - [ ] Security hardening applied & idempotent
  - [ ] Option snapshot test green
  - [ ] Function namespace tests green
  - [ ] Integrity scheduler registered once
  - [ ] Perf delta within provisional budget
  - [ ] Re-source idempotency verified

Open Decision (Resolved by Defaults):
- Namespace prefix: `zf::` adopted.
- Module cost ledger deferred to Stage 4.
- PATH append fix tracked as first Stage 3 task if still pending.

Upon completion, Stage 3 will establish a stable, secure, option-governed core onto which feature and plugin layers (Stage 4+) can attach without reintroducing baseline or integrity drift.

### 3.4 Stage 4 ‚Äì Feature Layer
Focus modules: `20-essential-plugins`, `30-development-env`, `40-aliases-keybindings`.

Key Deliverables:
- Plugin post-load augmentations (no early side-effects).
- Development toolchain discovery (Go/Rust/Python/Cargo/NPM).
- Consistent alias taxonomy + keybinding override map.

### 3.5 Stage 5 ‚Äì UI, Completion & Async
Focus modules: `50`, `60`, `70`, `80`, `90`.

| Module | Responsibility | Critical Gate |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 50-completion-history | Single guarded compinit + history settings | `_COMPINIT_DONE=1` exactly once |
| 60-ui-prompt | Prompt init isolation (p10k etc.) | No double initialization |
| 70-performance-monitoring | Precise segment capture (precmd hooks) | Adds <5ms overhead |
| 80-security-validation | Deferred deep hashing & integrity diff | Starts only after first prompt |
| 90-splash | Optional ephemeral output | Fully suppressible |

### 3.6 Stage 6 ‚Äì Promotion Readiness
Tasks:
- A/B capture (legacy toggles off vs redesign on).
- Validate performance delta meets gate.
- Async engine verified non-blocking & complete.
- Promotion guard PASS with all criteria.

### 3.7 Stage 7 ‚Äì Promotion & Archive
Actions:
1. Enable redesign toggles by default.
2. Generate new checksum snapshot (shifting "legacy" baseline).
3. Archive old directories (`*.legacy.YYYYMMDD`).
4. Update final performance & summary badges.
5. Announce new stable architecture.

---

## 4. Cross-Cutting Strategies

### 4.1 Performance Strategy
- Baseline captured before structural migration (see `perf-baseline.json`).
- Segmentation expanded early (Stage 2) to reduce risk before optimization phase.
- Tracked segments now include lifecycle totals + hotspot sub-segments (compinit, p10k_theme, gitstatus_init (conditional), plus layered module markers).
- Post-plugin cost is currently high (‚âà5s mean) and will be reduced iteratively; original Stage 6 absolute target (‚â§500ms) retained but now treated as final Phase ‚ÄúBudget‚Äù goal with interim phases.
- Regression guard (perf-diff) currently in observe (non-failing) mode; gating will ratchet in later phases.
- Instrumentation overhead kept minimal (segment-lib adds negligible cost; target <5ms aggregate).

#### 4.1.1 Interim Performance Roadmap (Phased Activation)

| Phase | Mode | Criteria / Actions | Failure Effect | Status |
|-------|------|--------------------|----------------|--------|
| Phase 0 | Observe | Collect `perf-current-segments.txt`, establish `perf-baseline-segments.txt` | None (informational) | ‚úÖ Active |
| Phase 1 | Warn | Enable `promotion-guard-perf.sh` warn thresholds (abs Œî, pct Œî, new segment allow) | Non-failing warnings | ‚è≥ Pending (after 2 stable baselines) |
| Phase 2 | Gate | Fail on regressions beyond thresholds when `PROMOTION_GUARD_PERF_FAIL=1` | Stage / PR block | ‚è≥ Planned |
| Phase 3 | Budget | Enforce absolute per-segment + aggregate budgets (hard fail) | Promotion block | ‚è≥ Planned |
| Phase 4 | Adaptive (Optional) | Auto-adjust rolling baseline after approved gate passes | Conditional | ‚è≥ Optional |

#### 4.1.2 Initial (Soft) Segment Budget Targets (Subject to Refinement)

| Segment | Current Mean (ms)* | Interim Soft Target | Final Budget Goal | Notes |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| post_plugin_total | ~5055 | ‚â§ 3000 (Phase 1‚Äì2) | ‚â§ 500 | Multi-pronged reduction (defer heavy loads, async) |
| compinit | 15 | ‚â§ 400 | ‚â§ 250 | Fast strategy already low; secure mode future impact |
| p10k_theme | 7 | ‚â§ 900 | ‚â§ 600 | Room reserved for prompt customization expansion |
| gitstatus_init | (n/a / missing) | ‚â§ 250 | ‚â§ 150 | Will measure once segment reliably emitted |
| pre_plugin_total | 96 | ‚â§ 120 | ‚â§ 100 | Already within targets; keep guard |
| prompt_ready (total) | 5852 | ‚â§ 3500 | ‚â§ 1000 | Will fall as post-plugin shrinks & async defers work |

*Current mean values sourced from latest `perf-current-segments.txt` (observe run). Missing segments treated as ‚Äúto be measured‚Äù before hard budgets activate.

#### 4.1.3 Gating & Threshold Evolution
- Observe ‚Üí Warn trigger: Two consecutive runs with <5% variance (stdev/mean) on lifecycle totals.
- Warn ‚Üí Gate trigger: Baseline refresh + validation tests for required segment coverage (compinit, p10k_theme, gitstatus_init (if applicable)).
- Gate ‚Üí Budget trigger: 3 successful gate cycles (no regressions) OR targeted optimization PR(s) hitting interim soft target for post_plugin_total.
- Budget Enforcement: Introduce gate G6 (existing) plus per-segment hard ceilings (compinit, p10k_theme, gitstatus_init) with immediate fail on exceedance.

#### 4.1.4 Additional Planned Enhancements
- Multi-sample capture implemented via `perf-capture-multi.zsh` (N‚â•3 samples) with stdev aggregation output to `perf-multi-current.json`.
- Rolling variance test implemented (`test-multi-sample-variance.zsh`) to gate observe ‚Üí warn transition (checks relative stddev & stability thresholds).
- perf-diff JSON emission implemented (`perf-diff.sh --json`) with stable schema (regressions/new/removed/improvements/unchanged) consumed by promotion guard now and intended for future automated gating correlation (e.g., combining regression + budget signals).
- Budget enforcement via `perf-segment-budget.sh` (interim/final phases; integrates with Gate G6 when ENFORCE=1)

All changes to thresholds / budgets must be reflected here and in gate tests to maintain TDD alignment.

Optional Pre-Plugin Budget Override Guidance:
To begin enforcing or tightening the pre-plugin phase cost before final budgets activate, you can layer a provisional budget on top of the Stage 2 baseline without waiting for full Phase 3 gating.

Recommended workflow:
1. Capture / refresh baseline:
   tools/preplugin-baseline-capture.zsh
   jq '.mean_ms' docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/preplugin-baseline.json
2. Choose an interim ceiling (e.g. mean * 1.10 for 10% headroom).
3. Run budget check locally (observe):
   BUDGET_PRE_PLUGIN_TOTAL=<ceiling_ms> ./tools/perf-segment-budget.sh
4. Enforce in CI (adds hard gate once stable):
   BUDGET_PRE_PLUGIN_TOTAL=<ceiling_ms> ENFORCE=1 ./tools/perf-segment-budget.sh
5. Pair with variance/regression test:
   tests/run-all-tests.zsh --performance-only
   (test-preplugin-baseline-threshold.zsh ensures <= allowed regression percentage)

Tightening Strategy:
- Start with +10% over baseline.
- After 3 consecutive green runs (low variance), reduce to +5%.
- When optimization work lands (e.g., further path pruning or lazy loader improvements), recalc baseline and repeat.
- Final target should align with Interim budget (‚â§120ms) then converge toward Final budget (‚â§100ms) as specified in the Performance Roadmap once consistent.

Environment Overrides Recap:
- BUDGET_PRE_PLUGIN_TOTAL=<ms> sets explicit ceiling.
- PREPLUGIN_ALLOWED_REGRESSION_PCT=<pct> adjusts threshold for test-preplugin-baseline-threshold.zsh.
- ALLOW_MISSING_GITSTATUS_INIT=1 (optional) avoids false negatives while early segments still stabilizing.

Rationale:
Applying a provisional enforced budget early reduces the window for silent regressions and creates immediate feedback loops for incremental refactors (e.g. forced lazy wrapping with lazy_register --force in module 25). This incremental ratcheting preserves TDD discipline while converging on promotion-grade performance guarantees.

### 4.2 Security & Integrity
| Layer | Strategy | Timing |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Early (00-security-integrity) | Lightweight fingerprint scheduling | During startup (no hashing) |
| Deferred (80-security-validation) | Hash & diff of plugin sources | After first prompt |
| Commands | `plugin_security_status`, `plugin_scan_now` | User-invoked or automated |
| State Machine | IDLE ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí SCANNING ‚Üí COMPLETE | Logged |
| Non-Blocking Guarantee | No `RUNNING` before prompt marker | Tested via async state tests |

### 4.3 Testing Strategy (Taxonomy)
| Category | Purpose | Representative Test |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Design | Structure, sentinels | `test-redesign-sentinels.zsh` |
| Unit | Isolated logic correctness | `test-lazy-framework.zsh` |
| Feature | High-level capability | `test-preplugin-ssh-agent-skeleton.zsh` |
| Integration | Cross-module | `test-postplugin-compinit-single-run.zsh` |
| Security | Async deferred validation | `test-async-state-machine.zsh` |
| Performance | Timing, segmentation integrity, observe‚Üíwarn gating | `test-segment-regression.zsh`, `test-required-segment-labels.zsh`, `test-promotion-guard-perf-block.zsh`, `test-multi-sample-variance.zsh`, `test-p10k-instrumentation.zsh`, `test-gitstatus-instrumentation.zsh` |
| Maintenance | Drift & checksums | `verify-legacy-checksums.zsh` |

### 4.4 Documentation Governance
- Version 2 layout ensures no duplication of stage roadmap.
- Artifacts separated from narrative.
- Stage-specific docs hold *execution detail*; this guide remains stable.
- Updates to metrics or stage status modify a single section here (Current Status + Stage tables).

---

### 4.5 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Policy

All implementation and migration activity MUST follow disciplined TDD:

| Aspect | Requirement | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Test First | A failing or absent test must be added/updated before implementing or modifying functionality | PR review + Gate G10 |
| Minimal Delta | Only write tests sufficient to express the next functional expectation | Code review |
| Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor | Commit sequence SHOULD show (a) failing test introduction (b) implementation pass (c) optional refactor without behavior change | Commit history audit |
| Coverage of Gates | Every Gate (G1‚ÄìG9) must have at least one explicit test asserting PASS/FAIL behavior | Test inventory |
| Regression Reproduction | Bugs require a reproducing failing test before fix | PR checklist |
| Determinism | New tests must be stable across ‚â•3 consecutive runs (no timing flake) | CI run-all-tests |
| Isolation | Unit tests avoid sourcing full runtime unless explicitly integration/feature category | Category taxonomy |
| Documentation Sync | When adding a new test category or gate test, update this section if policy expands | Review checklist |

TDD Workflow (Micro Loop):
1. Identify requirement / defect.
2. Add or modify the smallest failing test expressing the unmet behavior (commit: test-only).
3. Implement code to satisfy test (commit: feat/fix).
4. Refactor for clarity/perf without changing behavior (commit: refactor).
5. Validate full suite (design/unit/feature/integration/security/performance).
6. Update artifacts & docs only after tests are green.

Failure to supply a preceding failing test for a functional change blocks Stage exit or promotion readiness.

## 5. Metrics & Gates

| Gate ID | Description | Data Source | PASS Condition | Enforced At |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| G1 | Structure (counts & order) | structure-audit.json | 8 + 11 files, no duplicates | Every commit (CI) |
| G2 | Legacy drift | inventories + checksums | No checksum delta | Pre-promotion & periodic |
| G3 | Single compinit | Compinit tests | Exactly one run | Stage 5 exit |
| G4 | Async deferral | Async logs | No RUNNING pre-prompt | Stage 5/6 |
| G5 | Perf improvement | perf-current vs baseline | ‚â•20% reduction | Stage 6 |
| G5a | Perf diff observe mode active | `promotion-guard-perf.sh` (perf-diff block) | Structured PERF_GUARD block present (status=OK or SKIP) AND segments file discovered (non-failing observe) | Stage 5 (Observe) |
| G6 | Segment budgets | perf-current.json | post_plugin_cost ‚â§ 500ms | Stage 6 |
| G7 | Regression control | perf regression test | Œî ‚â§ 5% vs rolling baseline | Continuous |
| G8 | Sentinel compliance | design test | 100% modules guarded | Continuous |
| G9 | Tool health | verification script | All checks PASS | Pre-stage close |
| G10 | TDD policy adherence | Commit/test history, gate tests | Each functional change preceded by failing test; gates covered by explicit tests | Continuous + Stage exits |

| Risk | Phase | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Early Signal |
|------|-------|------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Silent structural drift | 2‚Äì7 | Medium | High | Inventory + checksum lock | Drift test fail |
| Over-eager async start | 5‚Äì6 | Low | Medium | Explicit deferral hook | RUNNING pre-prompt |
| Double compinit | 5 | Low | Medium | `_COMPINIT_DONE` guard + tests | Timestamp mismatch |
| Plugin load latency spike | 4‚Äì5 | Medium | Medium | Lazy wrappers; perf audit | Segment regression |
| PATH contamination | 2 | Medium | Medium | Path safety tests | Duplicate entries |
| Test flakiness (perf) | 2‚Äì6 | Medium | Low | Trim outliers; sample size | Stddev > threshold |
| Disabled rollbacks adoption drift | 6‚Äì7 | Low | High | Tag every stage | Missing tag |
| Doc divergence | 2‚Äì7 | Medium | Low | Single source consolidation | Lint mismatch |

## 9. Rollback & Recovery

| Scenario | Recommended Action | Data to Preserve | Re-Entry Step |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Stage failure (functional) | Revert to prior stage tag | Last good perf metrics | Re-apply module diffs in smaller chunks |
| Performance regression | Git bisect across stage commits | perf-current snapshots | Optimize offending module |

2. Implement minimal vertical slice (one module or sub-task).
3. Run: `verify-implementation.zsh`.
4. Run full or filtered tests: `tests/run-all-tests.zsh --design-only` + targeted categories.
5. For performance-sensitive changes: `tools/perf-capture.zsh` (compare).
6. Commit using defined message styles.
7. Open review referencing stage ID & sub-task IDs.
8. Tag upon stage completion *after* green test & guard pass.

### 1.4 Future / Logged Tasks (Discovered & Deferred)
(These items were identified during implementation of Tasks 1‚Äì9; not yet in active 7‚Äëday window. Move into Section 1.2 when promoted.)

Future / Deferred (F):
- F1: Integrate perf-drift-badge.sh into CI workflow (generate docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/perf-drift.json each perf run).
- F2: Add max_positive_regression_pct field directly into perf-module-ledger JSON (replace re-parse of perf-diff output).
- F3: Add JSON schema + version tag to perf-drift badge and ledger artifacts (enforce via test).
- F4: Enforce monotonic ordering test: pre_plugin_total <= post_plugin_total <= prompt_ready (strict once markers stable).
- F5: Add trust anchor golden manifest & hash once anchors >2 and hashing phase begins (Stage 5/6).
- F6: Extend micro-benchmark harness JSON test to validate schema bench-core.v1 and per_call_us drift (warn if >100% over baseline).
- F7: Create combined performance governance badge summarizing (variance state + max regression + over_budget_count).
- F8: Automate variance stability log append via workflow step (avoid manual edits).
- F9: Add stage3-exit-report.json machine-readable companion for promotion guard ingestion.
- F10: Add prompt/post-plugin threshold enforcement test (fail if prompt_ready_ms > interim soft target once real values appear).
- F11: Add ledger history diff to stage3-exit-report (if 2+ ledger history snapshots exist).
- F12: Build perf multi-sample cache invalidation test (ensures fingerprint change triggers capture).
- F13: Add optional MAD / median variance computation to perf-capture-multi.zsh (adaptive gating prototype).
- F14: Warn-on-missing drift badge suffix once max_positive_regression_pct embedding lands (test upgrade).
- F15: Add README badges row updates (perf drift, variance decision, micro bench) once artifacts stabilized.
- F16: Replace shim fallback with real Stage 3 function sourcing (ensure all zf:: functions loaded without shims before gating).
- F17: Add guard test that warns/fails if shimmed_count > 0 after Stage 3 (enforces real function benchmarking).
- F18: Automate micro benchmark re-baseline when core function manifest or function body checksums change (skip if no semantic diff).
- F19: Integrate micro benchmark median per-call regression summary into combined governance badge (add micro_regress_max_pct field).
- F20: Add noise filtering to micro benchmark harness (trim/winsorize top 5% outliers; record raw vs adjusted medians).
- F21: Drift badge gating escalation workflow (auto transition observe ‚Üí warn ‚Üí fail after variance RSD <5% for 2 consecutive runs & non-zero lifecycle trio).
- F22: Micro benchmark gating phase (warn on median_per_call_us > baseline * 2, fail on > baseline * 3 once shimmed_count == 0 and baseline stabilized).
- F23: Enforce monotonic lifecycle ordering strictly (pre ‚â§ post ‚â§ prompt) after two consecutive multi-sample runs with all three non-zero (upgrade test-perf-monotonic-lifecycle.zsh to strict).
- F24: Micro benchmark governance integration (add bench regression summary fields & badge; promote test-bench-core-regression.zsh from warn-only to gated after shimmed_count == 0).
- F25: (COMPLETED 2025-09-04) Governance badge CI integration delivered: generation wired into ci-perf-segments (PR + nightly multi-sample) and ci-perf-ledger-nightly workflows producing extended artifact (docs/redesignv2/artifacts/badges/governance.json) and simple shield (docs/badges/governance.json); README badge row scaffold added.
- F26: Promotion guard micro bench escalation (fail when microbench_worst_ratio >= MICRO_FAIL_FACTOR & shimmed_count == 0; warn when >= MICRO_WARN_FACTOR) once baseline finalized.
- F27: Governance badge infra-health & summary integration (weight governance severity in infra-health badge, include governance.json in badges summary aggregation, add variance-state source once artifact available, document weighting rationale).
- F28: Variance-state artifact & badge generation (produce variance-state.json with mode=observe|warn|gate & integrate as explicit governance source; add generation step to perf segments workflow).
- F29: Shim elimination audit script (enumerate currently shimmed helpers, diff vs manifest, emit actionable list prior to executing F16; add summary to governance extended JSON once shims=0).
- F30: Micro bench threshold codification (centralize BENCH_WARN_FACTOR=2.0 & BENCH_FAIL_FACTOR=3.0; update test-bench-core-regression.zsh + governance badge to consume unified factors).
- F31: README governance publishing cleanup (switch governance badge example to Pages endpoint, add embedding snippet & explanation of extended vs simple JSON).
- F32: Stage 3 exit report enhancement (include governance badge stats snapshot + last N variance log rows + monotonic status).
- F33: PR description template generator script (emit performance + governance summary block for maintainers; integrate optional GitHub Actions step).
- F34: Pages badge integrity manifest (generate badges-integrity.json with sha256 for governance / perf / structure; optional future signing step).
- F35: Micro benchmark drift detection (compare new run vs baseline medians; emit microbench_drift_count & microbench_worst_ratio into governance extended JSON).
- F36: Automated micro gating escalation (script watches for shimmed_count==0 + two stable drift-free runs to auto-suggest enabling micro bench gating env toggles).
- F37: Governance weighting matrix doc (document severity aggregation logic and planned infra-health weighting integration for governance badge).
- F38: (Implemented) post_plugin_total fallback aggregator (sum post_plugin_segments when post_plugin_cost_ms==0 & segments_available=true) to unblock monotonic validation path; verify first synthesized non-zero total before marking monotonic=ok path complete.
- F39: prompt_ready_ms reliability enhancement (inject explicit PROMPT_READY marker in harness after >2 consecutive approximations; add fallback counter + governance surface).
- F40: (COMPLETED 2025-09-04) Governance badge explicit variance-state integration (consumes variance-state.json instead of derived placeholder; removed ‚Äúderived‚Äù label & added stable_run_count passthrough).
- F41: Perf ledger embed max_positive_regression_pct (add field to perf-ledger JSON to eliminate drift badge re-parse inside governance aggregation).
- F48: Remove synthetic multi-sample replication hack from perf-capture-multi (replace cloned sample synthesis with authentic aggregation once loop reliability restored).
- F49: Repair perf-capture-multi loop termination (ensure >1 sample executes fully; add watchdog, retry semantics, robust error propagation).
- F50: Recompute variance-state.json using real multi-sample RSD after F49; update governance badge fields (drop synthetic indicators) and reassess observe ‚Üí warn transition readiness.

Promotion Pre-Requisites (will move to active window when nearing Stage 3 exit):
- PP1: Two consecutive stable multi-sample runs (RSD <5%) with non-zero post_plugin_total and prompt_ready_ms.

### Stage 3 Exit Readiness Checklist

| Check | Status (Target) | Evidence / Source | Notes / Action if Failing |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| PATH append invariant test passing | Required | tests/unit/... path normalization tests | Must be green; investigate helper if failing |
| Security skeleton idempotent | Required | security skeleton test + integrity scheduler log | Duplicate registration or reordered hooks ‚Üí fix module load |
| Option snapshot stability | Required | option snapshot golden diff test | Re-capture only with intentional change + documented rationale |
| Core function namespace stable | Required | core fn manifest + namespace tests | Regenerate manifest only after reviewed additions/removals |
| Integrity scheduler single registration | Required | integrity scheduler single-registration test | Ensure no duplicate deferred task insertion |
| Lifecycle segments non-zero (pre, post, prompt) | Required | perf-current.json multi-sample run | If post/prompt zero: inspect harness prompt hook emission |
| Monotonic lifecycle = ok (pre ‚â§ post ‚â§ prompt) | Required | promotion-guard output monotonic=ok | If warn: trace late segment or prompt timestamp race |
| Variance stability (‚â•2 low-RSD runs) | Target | Variance Stability Log (RSD <5%) | Needed before enabling warn/fail gating |
| Drift badge present & not fail | Required | docs/badges/perf-drift.json | If missing: ensure perf-diff & drift script step executed |
| Governance badge active (ok or warn only) | Required | docs/badges/governance.json | Fail severity blockers: high regression, over_budget in gate, micro fail |
| Perf ledger snapshots (‚â•2) with non-zero post | Target | ledger-history directory | Needed for early trend & budget tuning confidence |
| Micro benchmark baseline captured | Required | bench-core-baseline.json | If absent: run bench harness; ensure enumeration_mode != exports_fallback |
| shimmed_count == 0 (or plan F16 scheduled) | Target | bench-core-baseline.json shimmed_count | Blocker for micro gating escalation (F22/F26) |
| Promotion guard all checks pass (exit 0) | Required | CI promotion guard logs | Non-zero codes map to gating docs; resolve before exit |
| TDD gate (G10) pass | Required | enforce-tdd.sh log / guard output | Address failing new/changed test debt before promotion |
| Structure audit green (no violations) | Required | structure-audit.json / badge | Any violation blocks exit; fix ordering / duplicates |
| Path rules badge green | Required | path-rules badge JSON | Violations must be remediated (enforced fail-fast) |
| Infra health badge not red | Required | infra-health.json | Red indicates upstream gating failure or critical signal |
| Governance weighting integration planned (F27) | Informational | Future task list | Not blocking Stage 3 but note schedule |
| Stage 3 exit report generated | Required | stage3-exit-report.sh output | Include governance, variance, monotonic note, ledger snapshot summary |
| Gating readiness decision documented | Required | IMPLEMENTATION.md gating notes | Document enable_warn / enable_fail rationale & streak counts |
| Async shadow mode stable (no premature RUNNING) | Required | async-state.log & guard checks | Fail indicates async mis-sequencing |
| No red badges (perf / structure / governance) | Required | docs/badges/*.json | Red perf requires regression remediation |

Checklist Usage:
1. Run forced multi-sample capture (PERF_CAPTURE_FORCE=1) until lifecycle trio non-zero & monotonic=ok.
2. Update Variance Stability Log and confirm at least two low-RSD entries.
3. Ensure governance badge transitions from missing ‚Üí ok/warn (not fail).
4. Eliminate (or plan elimination of) shims prior to enabling micro gating tasks (F22/F26).
5. Generate stage3-exit-report.sh and attach to PR marking Stage 3 completion.

Exit Authorization Condition:
All Required items must be satisfied; Target items should be satisfied or explicitly deferred with documented rationale. Promotion should not proceed if any Required line shows failing status without an approved exception note recorded in IMPLEMENTATION.md.

- PP2: Gating toggle commit (PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=1) after PP1.
- PP3: Stage 3 exit mini-report generated & committed (stage3-exit-report.sh output).
- PP4: Optional micro baseline drift smoke (warn-only) enabled.
