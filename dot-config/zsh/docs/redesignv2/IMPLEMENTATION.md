## 0. Executive Summary

The ZSH configuration is being refactored from a fragmented legacy layout (dozens of loosely ordered files) into a deterministic, test-driven, **modular 19-file system**:
- **Pre-plugin phase (8 files)**: Prepare environment, defer heavy work, establish lazy frameworks.
- **Post-plugin phase (11 files)**: Functional layering (security ‚Üí options ‚Üí runtime ‚Üí completion ‚Üí UI ‚Üí performance ‚Üí async validation ‚Üí cosmetic).

Primary measurable targets:

| Objective | Baseline | Target | Evidence Source | Gate |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------|------|
| Startup mean (ms) | 4772ms | ‚â§3817ms (‚â•20% reduction) | `artifacts/metrics/perf-baseline.json`, `perf-current.json` | Promotion |
| Pre-plugin consolidation | 12 legacy fragments | 8 modules | Inventory diff | Stage 2 exit |
| Post-plugin consolidation | >25 active/latent | 11 modules | Structure audit | Stage 5 exit |
| Compinit executions | >1 risk | Exactly 1 | Compinit tests | Stage 5 exit |
| Deferred security hashing | Blocking at startup | Fully post-first prompt | Async logs & tests | Stage 6 gate |
| Regression control | None | ‚â§5% allowed | perf regression tests | Ongoing |
| Sentinel discipline | Inconsistent guards | 100% modules guarded | Sentinel test | Stage 3+ ongoing |
| Documentation drift | Ad-hoc | Consolidated, versioned | Lint & index | Ongoing |

## 2. Architecture & Stage Roadmap

### 2.1 Stage Overview (End-to-End)

| Stage | Label Tag | Scope | Exit Conditions | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | `refactor-stage1-complete` | Skeletons, tests, tooling, CI, verification | All infra tests PASS & tag created | ‚úÖ Done |
| 2 | `refactor-stage2-preplugin` | Implement pre-plugin 00‚Äì30 content | Path safety merged, lazy framework validated, pre-plugin baseline defined | üéØ Ready |
| 3 | `refactor-stage3-core` | Post 00/05/10 core modules | Security skeleton, interactive options, core functions implemented | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 4 | `refactor-stage4-features` | Post 20/30/40 feature layers | Plugin config, dev env exports, aliases/keybindings stable | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 5 | `refactor-stage5-ui-perf` | Post 50/60/70/80/90 (completion, UI, perf, async, splash) | Single compinit PASS, async queued & non-blocking | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 6 | `refactor-stage6-promotion-ready` | A/B validation + gates | All metrics & security gates PASS, promotion guard PASS | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 7 | `refactor-promotion-complete` | Toggle enable + checksum snapshot + archive legacy | New checksums + legacy archived + docs updated | ‚è≥ Pending |
| 8* | `refactor-cleanup` | (Optional) Drift test retirement, doc pruning | Lean stable footprint | ‚è≥ Optional |

*Stage 8 is optional hardening/cleanup after adoption.

### 2.2 Module Sequencing Logic
1. **Early path stability** ensures subsequent modules assume normalized environment.
2. **Lazy mechanics before heavy runtimes** (Node, direnv) prevents unnecessary early cost.
3. **Security integrity (light) precedes functional augmentation** but defers heavy hashing.
4. **Completion & prompt unify late** to guarantee single compinit and stable UI.
5. **Performance capture & async scanning** near end to avoid polluting early timing.

## 3. Detailed Stage Execution

### 3.1 Stage 1 (Completed) ‚Äì Foundation
Delivered:
- Inventories & checksum freeze.
- Redesign skeleton directories (guards + ordering).
- Sentinel audit & structure tests.
- Segment-aware perf capture tool.
- Async state test scaffolding.
- Promotion guard (structure + perf + checksum + async precondition logic).
- Central verification script.

Artifacts:
- Tag: `refactor-stage1-complete`
- Metrics: `artifacts/metrics/perf-baseline.json`
- Structure: `artifacts/metrics/structure-audit.json`

### 3.2 Stage 2 ‚Äì Pre-Plugin Content Migration
Goals:
- Collapse legacy path fix scripts into `00-path-safety.zsh`.
- Implement minimal FZF init (no remote clones, no compinit).
- Build production lazy dispatcher (`10-lazy-framework.zsh`).
- Add node/npm lazy stubs & deferral semantics.
- Wrap integrations (direnv/git/copilot) with idempotent shims.
- Harden SSH agent consolidation (single spawn logic).

Success Metrics:
| Aspect | Gate |
|--------|------|
| Pre-plugin run cost | ‚â§ legacy pre-plugin baseline (target -10%) |
| Lazy framework calls | First call triggers load; subsequent calls constant cost |
| Path normalization | No duplicate PATH segments; tests green |
| Agent duplication | 0 new processes when socket present |

Exit Steps:
1. Run full test suite (all green).
2. Capture `preplugin-baseline.json`.
3. Tag `refactor-stage2-preplugin`.

### 3.3 Stage 3 ‚Äì Post-Plugin Core
Focus modules: `00-security-integrity`, `05-interactive-options`, `10-core-functions`.

Key Deliverables:
- Security baseline stub: schedule (not run) deep plugin integrity scan task.
- Centralized `setopt` / `unsetopt` & zstyles (no path/environment contamination).
- Core utility functions with namespace-safe patterns.

### 3.4 Stage 4 ‚Äì Feature Layer
Focus modules: `20-essential-plugins`, `30-development-env`, `40-aliases-keybindings`.

Key Deliverables:
- Plugin post-load augmentations (no early side-effects).
- Development toolchain discovery (Go/Rust/Python/Cargo/NPM).
- Consistent alias taxonomy + keybinding override map.

### 3.5 Stage 5 ‚Äì UI, Completion & Async
Focus modules: `50`, `60`, `70`, `80`, `90`.

| Module | Responsibility | Critical Gate |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 50-completion-history | Single guarded compinit + history settings | `_COMPINIT_DONE=1` exactly once |
| 60-ui-prompt | Prompt init isolation (p10k etc.) | No double initialization |
| 70-performance-monitoring | Precise segment capture (precmd hooks) | Adds <5ms overhead |
| 80-security-validation | Deferred deep hashing & integrity diff | Starts only after first prompt |
| 90-splash | Optional ephemeral output | Fully suppressible |

### 3.6 Stage 6 ‚Äì Promotion Readiness
Tasks:
- A/B capture (legacy toggles off vs redesign on).
- Validate performance delta meets gate.
- Async engine verified non-blocking & complete.
- Promotion guard PASS with all criteria.

### 3.7 Stage 7 ‚Äì Promotion & Archive
Actions:
1. Enable redesign toggles by default.
2. Generate new checksum snapshot (shifting "legacy" baseline).
3. Archive old directories (`*.legacy.YYYYMMDD`).
4. Update final performance & summary badges.
5. Announce new stable architecture.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Strategies

### 4.1 Performance Strategy
- Baseline captured before structural migration.
- Segments tracked: total, pre-plugin, post-plugin.
- Threshold enforcement: Post-plugin segment target ‚â§500ms average.
- Regression guard fails >5% variance (rolling baseline acceptable after stabilization).

### 4.2 Security & Integrity
| Layer | Strategy | Timing |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Early (00-security-integrity) | Lightweight fingerprint scheduling | During startup (no hashing) |
| Deferred (80-security-validation) | Hash & diff of plugin sources | After first prompt |
| Commands | `plugin_security_status`, `plugin_scan_now` | User-invoked or automated |
| State Machine | IDLE ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí SCANNING ‚Üí COMPLETE | Logged |
| Non-Blocking Guarantee | No `RUNNING` before prompt marker | Tested via async state tests |

### 4.3 Testing Strategy (Taxonomy)
| Category | Purpose | Representative Test |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Design | Structure, sentinels | `test-redesign-sentinels.zsh` |
| Unit | Isolated logic correctness | `test-lazy-framework.zsh` |
| Feature | High-level capability | `test-preplugin-ssh-agent-skeleton.zsh` |
| Integration | Cross-module | `test-postplugin-compinit-single-run.zsh` |
| Security | Async deferred validation | `test-async-state-machine.zsh` |
| Performance | Timing & thresholds | `test-segment-regression.zsh` |
| Maintenance | Drift & checksums | `verify-legacy-checksums.zsh` |

### 4.4 Documentation Governance
- Version 2 layout ensures no duplication of stage roadmap.
- Artifacts separated from narrative.
- Stage-specific docs hold *execution detail*; this guide remains stable.
- Updates to metrics or stage status modify a single section here (Current Status + Stage tables).
