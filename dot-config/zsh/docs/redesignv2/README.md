# ZSH Configuration Redesign Documentation
**Version 2.4** ‚Äì Core Hardening, Perf/Bench & Governance Badge Integration Updates  
**Status**: Stage 2 Complete (baseline & tag created) ‚Äì Stage 3 (Core Modules) In Progress  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-04

## üîú Recommended Next Steps (Updated Summary)

Focused execution priorities for the remainder of Stage 3 (after recent additions: trust anchor read APIs, micro-benchmark harness with shim fallback, variance stability log, perf drift badge script, multi-sample fingerprint caching):

1. Multi-Sample Segment Refresh & Monotonic Validation  
   - Force a fresh multi-sample run: `PERF_CAPTURE_FORCE=1 tools/perf-capture-multi.zsh` to obtain non‚Äëzero `post_plugin_total` & `prompt_ready_ms`.  
   - Confirm monotonic lifecycle (`pre ‚â§ post ‚â§ prompt`) shows `monotonic=ok` (promotion-guard note).  
   - Append new Variance Stability Log row (IMPLEMENTATION.md ¬ß1.3) with refreshed metrics.

2. Governance & Drift Integration (Governance badge now active)  
   - Governance badge generation integrated in perf + nightly workflows (extended artifact + simple shield). Monitor first artifact; once stable, reference it via Pages endpoint.  
   - Continue stabilizing perf drift badge; after two consecutive low-RSD (<5%) runs with non‚Äëzero trio, prepare enabling `PERF_DIFF_FAIL_ON_REGRESSION=1` (warn‚Üígate).

3. Micro-Benchmark Baseline & Shim Removal Plan  
   - If not yet committed: `bench-core-functions.zsh --json --iterations 5000 --repeat 3 > docs/redesignv2/artifacts/metrics/bench-core-baseline.json`.  
   - Draft F16 shim removal plan (enumerate currently shimmed helpers) to unlock micro bench gating path (F22/F26).  
   - Track `shimmed_count` reduction in future governance badge stats.

4. Test / Enforcement Enhancements  
   - Promote monotonic lifecycle test to strict after two passes with non‚Äëzero trio + monotonic=ok.  
   - Define micro bench thresholds (warn ‚â•2x, fail ‚â•3x median) aligned with governance script factors.  
   - Elevate drift badge presence test from warn to enforce after first stable governance cycle.

5. Documentation & Badges  
   - Governance badge row scaffold present; remove "(pending)" tag once first published artifact verified.  
   - Update Stage 3 readiness checklist when governance badge appears green (no FAIL conditions).  
   - Add variance decision badge once variance-state artifact implemented.

6. Stage 3 Exit Preparation  
   - Collect evidence set: PATH invariant, security skeleton idempotency, option snapshot, core namespace stability, single scheduler registration, provisional perf budget adherence, micro baseline + governance badge green.  
   - Run `stage3-exit-report.sh` after governance + drift + non‚Äëzero segment validation.

7. Future Promotion Hooks (Logged)  
   - Execute F16 (remove shims) ‚Üí enables F17 (shim guard) & micro gating (F22/F26).  
   - Integrate ledger max regression embedding (F2) & future variance-state source into governance badge.  
   - Prepare combined infra-health weighting once governance badge stable across ‚â•3 nightly runs.

## üéØ **Project Overview**

The redesign transforms a fragmented 40+ file setup into a deterministic **8 pre-plugin + 11 post-plugin** modular system aiming for **‚â•20% startup improvement** alongside maintainability, safety, and auditability.

### **Key Metrics**
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Current Status |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Startup Time | 4772ms | ‚â§3817ms (20% improvement) | Optimization phase pending |
| Module Count | 40+ fragments | 19 modules (8+11) | ‚úÖ Structure ready |
| Test Coverage | Limited legacy | 100+ comprehensive tests | ‚úÖ 67+ implemented (growth ongoing) |
| Performance Gates | Observe mode | Automated regression gating | üîÑ Observe (diff + variance) active |
| Path Rules Compliance | (legacy untracked) | 0 violations | ![Path Rules](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/gh-pages/badges/path-rules.json) |

> Path Rules badge enforces zero direct raw path extraction outside helpers; failure is immediate (CI fail-fast).  
> Helper standard: `zf::script_dir` / `resolve_script_dir`.

## Badge Legend (Expanded ‚Äì New Pending Rows)

| Badge (JSON) | Shield Label | Meaning | Green Criteria | Red Criteria | Source Tool / Job |
|--------------|--------------|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|

| variance-state.json (planned) | variance | Enforcement mode state | Reported mode matches conditions | Inconsistent / stale | variance decision step |
| governance.json | governance | Aggregated redesign governance signals (perf drift, perf ledger, variance mode (derived until variance-state.json exists), micro bench baseline) | All source signals present; severity ok or warn only; no FAIL triggers (max regression <10%, over_budget_count=0 OR variance_mode!=gate, no micro fail) | Any fail trigger (max regression ‚â•10%, over_budget_count>0 in gate mode, microbench fail ratio, or all sources missing) | generate-governance-badge.zsh (ci-perf-segments + nightly ledger) |

Notes:
- Rows labeled (pending) activate after first artifact commit; placeholders here aid discoverability. Governance badge is now active (row no longer marked pending).
- `perf-drift.json` message will embed max positive regression once ledger integration finalizes.
- Micro benchmark badge remains informational until shim elimination (F16/F17) and micro gating thresholds enforced.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety & Quality Assurance**

### Automated Safety Gates
- Structure & sentinel validation
- Performance diff (observe ‚Üí future warn/gate)
- Path rules enforcement (badge + fail-fast)
- Option snapshot & namespace stability
- Async deferral strategy (shadow now; activation later)
- Checksum freeze (legacy integrity baseline)

### Performance Monitoring
- Lifecycle segments: `pre_plugin_total`, `post_plugin_total`, `prompt_ready`
- Hotspot segments: `compinit`, `p10k_theme`, (conditional) `gitstatus_init`
- Variance & regression: multi-sample JSON + diff tooling
- Micro benchmark harness (core helpers dispatch overhead & helper latency)

## üéØ **Success Criteria (Snapshot)**

| Objective | Current | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| ‚â•20% startup improvement | Pending optimization | ‚â§3817ms |
| Module consolidation | 19 modules stable | Maintain 8 + 11 |
| Test coverage growth | 67+ tests | 100+ (Stage 5+) |
| Single compinit | Deferred | Exactly 1 (Stage 5 exit) |
| Async non-blocking | Shadow only | Verified gating (Stage 6) |
| Perf gating | Observe | Gate (variance qualified) |
| Micro benchmark baseline | Harness ready | Baseline committed |

---

## üìû **Support & Troubleshooting**

- **Performance anomalies**: Re-run multi-sample capture; inspect `perf-multi-current.json` and drift badge output.
- **Benchmark oddities**: Check `shimmed_count` in micro bench JSON; if >0, enumeration fallback occurred (replace shims before enforcing drift).
- **Namespace drift**: Run function manifest test (see IMPLEMENTATION.md for invocation details).

---

## üìä **Project Statistics**

- **Total Modules**: 19 (8 + 11)  
- **Tests**: 67+ (design / unit / feature / integration / security / performance)  
- **Perf Tooling**: Segment capture, diff, ledger prototype, drift badge script  
- **Benchmarking**: Core function harness (shim-aware, JSON artifact)  
- **Governance**: Variance log, trust anchor APIs, path rules badge, helper verifier

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Micro-Benchmark Harness Notes

- JSON meta fields include:
  - `enumeration_mode`: `dynamic` | `exports_fallback`
  - `shimmed_count`: Number of functions replaced with no-op shims (dispatch overhead only)
  - `version`: `bench-core.v1`
- Baseline is observational until all shims eliminated.
- Drift logic (planned): warn if median per-call exceeds baseline median * 2 (temporary heuristic) until stricter statistical threshold introduced.

---

**Next Action Reminder**: Capture multi-sample after ensuring lifecycle trio instrumentation ‚Üí integrate drift badge ‚Üí record variance log entry ‚Üí commit micro bench baseline ‚Üí prepare Stage 3 exit report.
