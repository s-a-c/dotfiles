## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Begin Phase 1 of test improvement plan (foundation work)
2. Install required testing tools (kcov, hyperfine, bats-core)
3. Create test isolation framework with setup/teardown hooks
4. Implement parallel test execution support

### Stage 3 Exit Requirements
- Complete 7-day CI ledger stability window
- Execute comprehensive test suite with redesign enabled
- Verify all Stage 3 exit criteria are met

## Summary

Part 08.16 successfully established comprehensive ZSH testing standards and created a detailed improvement plan for the test suite. The testing standards have been integrated into both the ZSH redesign documentation and the AI guidelines, ensuring consistency across all development efforts. The 8-week test improvement plan provides a clear roadmap for achieving production-ready test coverage with proper isolation, performance validation, and security testing.

The next phase focuses on implementing the foundation improvements outlined in Week 1-2 of the test improvement plan, while continuing progress toward Stage 3 completion and eventual production promotion.
