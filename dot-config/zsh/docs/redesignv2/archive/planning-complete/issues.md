# Configuration Code Review – Issues & Recommendations (Consolidated Copy)
Date: 2025-08-30
Source: Migrated from root docs/review/issues.md for centralized redesign documentation.

(See original version for detailed rationale; this copy maintained for in-tree redesign reference.)

## 1. Severity Legend
- Critical: Direct performance/security risk or functional break potential
- Major: Architectural/maintainability concern; latent risk
- Minor: Style, clarity, redundancy (low immediate impact)

## 2. Summary Matrix
| Severity | Count | Addressed in Plan | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Critical | 4 | Yes (Phases 4–6, 7) | Deferred hashing, fragmentation, integrity sync cost, single compinit control |
| Major | 10 | Yes (Phases 3–6, 11) | Prefix scheme, function split, prompt coupling, completion zstyle placement, async dispatcher absence |
| Minor | 14 | Rolling (Phases 9, 11, 12) | Backups, naming, comments, path duplicates, log noise |

## 3. Detailed Findings (Abbreviated)
Refer to master version for full tables. Key critical IDs: C1–C4.

## 4–9
Full content preserved in original; remediation strategies referenced by implementation-plan & master-plan.
