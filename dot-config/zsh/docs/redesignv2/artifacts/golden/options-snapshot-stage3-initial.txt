# options-snapshot-stage3-initial.txt
# Golden snapshot for Stage 3 initial interactive option baseline.
# Purpose:
#   Serves as the canonical reference for idempotency / drift tests once
#   golden comparison is wired. Lines formatted: option=on|off
# Scope (monitored set – matches test-option-snapshot-stability list):
#   append_history, autocd, extendedglob, hist_ignore_all_dups,
#   hist_ignore_space, hist_reduce_blanks, interactive_comments,
#   promptsubst, share_history
# Assumptions:
#   - Module 05 sets: hist_ignore_all_dups, hist_reduce_blanks, share_history,
#     interactive_comments, autocd (as auto_cd), append_history remains off
#     (inc_append_history is used instead), others default off.
#   - This snapshot reflects the desired INITIAL state after first load.
# Update Policy:
#   - If an intentional option state change is introduced, update this file
#     in the same commit and note the rationale in IMPLEMENTATION.md.
#   - Avoid toggling options here without corresponding module logic change.
#
# Generated: Stage 3 (initial) – edit manually with justification.
