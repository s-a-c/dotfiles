> Source of truth for Stage 4 Feature Layer scope, lifecycle, and implementation status.  
> Every feature listed here MUST have: metadata, tests (contract + failure containment if applicable), and documented enable/disable semantics.

## Status Summary

- Done: 1  
- In Progress: 0 (registry scaffold + tests considered infrastructure, not a feature entry)  
- Planned (Stage 4 scope): 16  
- Deferred beyond Stage 4: 1 (ai-suggestions)  

---

## Phase Grouping Roadmap (Planned)

### Phase 1 (Early / Foundational)
- noop (complete)
- prompt-core
- safety-boundaries

### Phase 2 (Standard Interactive)
- history-adv
- completion-aug
- keybinding-profiles
- nav-smartcd
- git-segment (base hooks; async portion may span phase 3)
- env-runtime-detect
- direnv-guard
- search-grep-layer
- prompt-rprompt-policy

### Phase 3 (Deferred / Async / Telemetry)
- fzf-integration
- telemetry-core
- perf-delta-guard
- prompt-async-post
- plugin-shims

### Future / Outside Stage 4
- ai-suggestions (explicitly deferred; requires additional policy & security review)

## Feature Lifecycle Requirements

Each feature must provide before marking “In Progress”:
1. Metadata variables (exact variable names consistent with template).
2. Contract functions:
   - `feature_<name>_metadata`
   - `feature_<name>_is_enabled`
   - `feature_<name>_register`
   - `feature_<name>_init`
3. Tests:
   - Contract & metadata extraction
   - Enable/disable semantics (if not purely default)
   - Failure containment (init failure injection or inert path)
   - (If >20ms synchronous cost) performance delta test
4. Compliance header with current guidelines checksum.
5. Catalog entry updated (Status -> In Progress).

Mark “Done” only when:
- All tests pass under `zsh -f` via `run-all-tests-v2.zsh`
- No unbounded synchronous cost >20ms (unless granted exception)
- Dependency graph validated (no warnings / cycles)
- Failure injection test (if supplied) contained correctly

---

## Dependency & Ordering Rules

- Dependencies must be declared in the feature module metadata and are validated by the registry resolver.
- Cycles: Prohibited; will produce ERROR logs and block invocation ordering.
- Disabled dependencies: Allowed only if dependent feature also disables itself or handles the absence gracefully.
- Deferred features (Phase 3) must not block prompt readiness (tested).

---

## Performance Guardrails (Stage 4)

| Guard Type | Threshold | Action |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Aggregate cold start (interim) | +15% over 334ms | CI fail (planned gate) |
| Single feature synchronous | >20ms | Warning + evaluate deferral |
| Telemetry overhead when enabled | <5ms added | Monitor only |
| Deferred postprompt budget | <100ms cumulative async | Monitor; degrade if exceeded |

Telemetry features (when implemented) must default OFF; enabling must not permanently skew baseline metrics.

---

## Compliance & Policy Reminders

- All sensitive external interactions (spawning processes, PATH amendments) must cite guideline references with file:line style references inline.
- Changes to enablement semantics require corresponding test updates.
- Guidelines checksum changes mandate updating the compliance header (current: 3fb33a85972b794c3c0b2f992b1e5a7c19cfbd2ccb3bb519f8865ad8fdfc0316).

---

## Maintenance Workflow

1. Add new feature row (Status=Planned).
2. Implement contract + minimal skeleton -> set Status=In Progress.
3. Add tests; ensure green CI.
4. Optimize & validate performance (if applicable).
5. Update row to Done; link PR number (future column).
6. If removed, set Status=Dropped (retain row for historical audit).
7. If postponed to later stages, set Status=Deferred with rationale.

---

## Planned Future Columns (Not Yet Active)

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| PR     | Link to merge PR implementing primary feature scope |
| Added  | Commit/date of initial introduction |
| Delta(ms) | Measured synchronous startup cost contribution |
| Async(ms) | Deferred cumulative async completion time |
| Test IDs | Canonical test file references |

---

## Open Decisions (Tracked)

| Topic | Pending Decision |
|-------|------------------|
| Telemetry default | OFF (needs confirmation when telemetry-core lands) |
| Invocation wrapper timing format | Likely key=value lines aggregated per feature |
| Failure severity policy | Non-zero feature init returns are tolerated; logged with severity=error |
| Partial dependency disable semantics | Warn only vs strict fail – current direction: warn |

Maintainers: update this catalog atomically with feature module + test changes to prevent drift.
