# Draft: .github/workflows/perf-nightly.yml
#
# Purpose:
# - Scheduled nightly perf capture for the redesign feature branch.
# - Runs the perf harness with `ZSH_USE_REDESIGN=1` and uploads ledger artifacts as GitHub workflow artifacts.
# - This is a draft for review and will be added to the feature branch only when approved.
#
# Notes:
# - The workflow is intentionally conservative: it tolerates missing perf scripts and emits placeholder artifacts so the job never fails purely due to missing runner-side helpers.
# - Artifacts are uploaded but NOT copied into the repository. The job writes to the runner workspace (tools/perf/ledgers/) and uploads that directory as an artifact.
# - The workflow is intended to run only for the feature branch `feature/zsh-refactor-configuration` by default; manual dispatch is supported.
#
# Reviewer guidance:
# - Confirm the perf capture command (here: `./tools/perf-capture.sh`) and output path.
# - Confirm any additional runner packages (jq, zip, etc.) required by the perf scripts.
# - Decide on artifact retention settings in the repository settings if different from the default.
