## 1. Purpose

Establish a **safe, testable baseline** for all future migration work without changing functional behavior of the legacy runtime. Stage 1 focuses on scaffolding rather than content migration.

---

## 2. Scope (Inclusions / Exclusions)

| Included | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Redesign skeleton directories | `.zshrc.pre-plugins.d.REDESIGN` (8 placeholders) & `.zshrc.d.REDESIGN` (11 placeholders) with sentinel guards |
| Inventories & checksum freeze | Immutable point-in-time snapshot of legacy active & disabled sets |
| Test taxonomy bootstrap | Design, unit scaffold, feature, integration, security (async), performance |
| Tooling enhancements | Promotion guard (structure+perf+checksum+async pre-check), perf segment capture, implementation verification script |
| CI workflow | Structure badge workflow (validation + artifact generation) |
| Documentation consolidation (v2 base) | New `redesignv2/` hub with README + IMPLEMENTATION + ARCHITECTURE + REFERENCE |
| Async & performance scaffolds | State log format + async state tests (no heavy hashing yet) |

| Excluded | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Actual module logic port | Deferred to Stages 2–5 |
| Lazy framework production code | Implemented later (Stage 2) |
| Security deep hashing | Deferred by design (Stage 5/6) |
| A/B performance deltas | Require migrated content |
| Toggle default enablement | Occurs at promotion (Stage 7) |

---

|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Immutable legacy baseline | `legacy-checksums.sha256` committed & verified | ✅ |
| Structural skeleton (8+11) | Structure audit shows total=19, violations=0 | ✅ |
| Sentinel discipline enforced | Sentinel test PASS on redesign trees | ✅ |

---

## 4. Deliverables (Artifacts)

| Pre-plugin inventory | `docs/redesign/planning/preplugin-inventory.txt` (also mirrored in redesignv2/artifacts/inventories when migrated) | Frozen list of original fragments |
| Post-plugin inventory | `docs/redesign/planning/postplugin-inventory.txt` | Baseline for consolidation mapping |
| Disabled inventory | `docs/redesign/planning/postplugin-disabled-inventory.txt` | Accounts for dormant modules |
| Legacy checksums | `docs/redesign/planning/legacy-checksums.sha256` | Mutation guard anchor |
| Perf baseline | `docs/redesign/metrics/perf-baseline.json` | Target comparison dataset |
| Structure audit | `docs/redesign/metrics/structure-audit.json` & `.md` | Count/order/violation ledger |
| Badge JSON (structure/perf) | `docs/redesign/badges/*.json` | CI & dashboards |

| Perf capture tool (enhanced) | `tools/perf-capture.zsh` | Segment-aware timing |
| Verification script | `verify-implementation.zsh` | Developer fast health check |
| Test runner | `tests/run-all-tests.zsh` | Unified execution harness |
| Async tests | `tests/security/test-async-state-machine.zsh` | State progression validation |
| Sentinel test | `tests/design/test-redesign-sentinels.zsh` | Module guard enforcement |
| Compinit integration test (legacy) | `tests/integration/test-compinit-single-run.zsh` | Baseline single-run guarantee |

---

## 5. Task Breakdown (Executed)

| ID | Task | Output | Verification |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| S1.1 | Inventory freeze | 3 inventory files | Manual diff + drift tests scaffold |
| S1.2 | Skeleton trees | 19 guarded empty modules | Structure audit = PASS |
| S1.3 | Sentinel enforcement | Added `_LOADED_*` guards | Sentinel test PASS |
| S1.4 | Baseline perf capture | perf-baseline.json | File integrity + plausible values |
| S1.5 | Test runner build | Multi-category harness | Colored summary & exit codes |
| S1.6 | Async state scaffolding | Log format + initial tests | Monotonic timestamp checks |
| S1.7 | Promotion guard v1 | Combined validation script | Dry run exit 0 |
| S1.8 | Perf capture enhancement | Segment fields in current metrics | JSON includes pre/post keys |
| S1.9 | Documentation v2 hub | README + IMPLEMENTATION + ARCHITECTURE + REFERENCE | Cross-link integrity |
| S1.10 | CI workflow (structure) | `.github/workflows/structure-badge.yml` | Local lint & placeholder run |
| S1.11 | Verification helper | `verify-implementation.zsh` | PASS summary output |
| S1.12 | Tag stage completion | `refactor-stage1-complete` | Visible via `git tag` |

## 6. Validation Matrix

| Aspect | Tool/Test | PASS Evidence |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Structure count | structure audit | `"total":19,"violations":[]` |
| Ordering monotonicity | structure audit | `order_issue:false` |
| Sentinel coverage | design test | 0 missing sentinel lines |
| Baseline reproducibility | perf capture rerun | Mean within expected variance (≤5% stddev) |
| Async not prematurely RUNNING | async initial test | No RUNNING pre PROMPT marker |
| Tool health | verification script | All PASS lines; no FAIL |
| Checksum immutability | verify checksums | Exit 0 |

---

## 7. Risks Addressed in Stage 1

| Risk | Mitigation Introduced |
|------|-----------------------|
| Undetected legacy drift | Checksums + frozen inventories |
| Structural sprawl | Fixed skeleton counts + audit tooling |
| Future test fragility | Unified runner & category filters |
| Premature async execution | State machine contract + tests |
| Performance baseline contamination | Early capture before migration begins |
| Documentation fragmentation | Consolidated v2 layout |

---

## 8. Known Limitations (Intentional Deferrals)

| Limitation | Deferred To | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Actual lazy loader code | Stage 2 | Needs path safety migration context |
| Deep security hashing | Stage 5/6 | Avoid early overhead complexity |
| Single compinit enforcement in redesign tree | Stage 5 | Module 50 not populated yet |
| Security command helpers | Stage 6 | Depends on async engine integration |
| A/B performance comparison (legacy vs redesign) | Stage 6 | Requires migrated content presence |

---

## 9. Entry Criteria for Stage 2 (All Met ✅)

| Criterion | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Baseline metrics captured | perf-baseline.json | ✅ |
| Skeleton directories stable | Structure audit | ✅ |
| Sentinel discipline established | Sentinel test | ✅ |
| Promotion guard scaffold operational | Dry run logs | ✅ |
| Async scaffolding validated | Async tests PASS | ✅ |
| Docs consolidated & indexed | redesignv2 README | ✅ |
| Tag created for traceability | `git tag -l` output | ✅ |

---

## 10. Exit Artifacts Archive Policy

Stage 1 artifacts **MUST NOT** be modified retroactively. Any mutation:
1. Fails checksum verification.
2. Invalidates rollback integrity.
3. Requires a new ADR entry if absolutely necessary.

---

## 11. How to Reproduce Stage 1 Validation (For Auditors)

```bash
# 1. Confirm tag presence
git tag | grep refactor-stage1-complete

# 2. Run verification
./verify-implementation.zsh

# 3. Run full tests
tests/run-all-tests.zsh

# 4. Confirm structure audit alignment
jq '.total,.violations|length,.order_issue' docs/redesign/metrics/structure-audit.json

# 5. Check baseline metrics
jq '.mean_ms? // .cold_ms' docs/redesign/metrics/perf-baseline.json
```

---

## 12. Lessons Learned / Adjustments

| Topic | Observation | Action Taken |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Sentinel naming | Initial variance in pre-plugin naming format | Standardized `_LOADED_<TRANSFORMED_FILENAME>` in v2 docs |
| Async timing assertions | Needed explicit prompt marker sequencing | Added dual tests (initial + state machine) |
| Perf capture clarity | Single-run ambiguity | Added segment fields & `segments_available` flag |
| Doc redundancy | Multiple competing plan docs | Consolidated into IMPLEMENTATION.md |

---

## 13. ADR References (Relevant)

| ADR | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| ADR-001 | Numeric rigid layering (8+11) |
| ADR-002 | Centralized single compinit (future enforce) |
| ADR-003 | Deferred deep hashing (post prompt) |
| ADR-005 | Artifact vs narrative separation |
| ADR-006 | Checksum freeze prerequisite |

(Full list in `../ARCHITECTURE.md`.)

## 14. Handoff Summary (To Stage 2 Owner)

**You now have**:  
- Immutable baseline + structure guardrails  
- Performance baseline to protect improvements  
- Async & perf instrumentation scaffolds  
- A test harness ready to validate each migrated module incrementally  

**You must**:  
- Migrate pre-plugin logic incrementally (00 → 30)  
- Preserve baseline toggles until redesign path parity confirmed  
- Keep PATH & lazy loader changes isolated per commit for traceability  
- Re-capture pre-plugin delta metrics before exiting Stage 2
