# Stage 2 â€“ Preâ€‘Plugin Content Migration
Version: 1.0  
Status: ðŸŽ¯ Ready (Execution Not Yet Begun)  
Planned Tag on Completion: `refactor-stage2-preplugin`  
Last Updated: 2025-01-03

> Stage 2 migrates **legacy early-path & preparation logic** into the redesigned preâ€‘plugin module set (00â€“30).  
> No userâ€‘visible behavior (besides performance & cleanliness) should change.  
> Architecture rules & crossâ€‘stage roadmap live in `../IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `../ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 1. Purpose

Transform legacy scattered early initialization (path repair, adâ€‘hoc environment tweaks, early tool activation) into **four cohesive responsibility layers**:

| Module | Responsibility | Highâ€‘Level Outcome |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| 00-path-safety.zsh | Deterministic PATH + hygiene | Stable, deduplicated, precedence-safe PATH |
| 05-fzf-init.zsh | Lightweight FZF keymaps only | No heavy binary sourcing before interaction |
| 10-lazy-framework.zsh | Generic lazy dispatcher | Foundation for deferred tool & integration loads |
| 15-node-runtime-env.zsh | Node/npm stub wrappers | Zero nvm/npm cost until first actual use |
| 20-macos-defaults-deferred.zsh | Safe macOS tweaks deferral | No blocking `defaults` calls during cold start |
| 25-lazy-integrations.zsh | direnv/git/copilot lazy shells | On-demand activation; idempotent wrappers |
| 30-ssh-agent.zsh | Single agent mgmt | Prevent duplicate agents & silent socket churn |
| 40-pre-plugin-reserved.zsh | Reserved | Capacity for emergent need without renumbering |

---

## 2. Scope

| Included | Excluded |
|----------|----------|
| Path normalization & dedup logic migration | Any post-plugin configuration (options, aliases, env exports beyond PATH) |
| Lazy loader core implementation | Deep security hashing (Stage 5/6) |
| Node/npm deferral stubs | Real plugin reordering |
| macOS deferred operations scaffold | Prompt/UI changes |
| Consolidated SSH agent function | Completion subsystem changes |
| Integration (direnv/git/copilot) lazy wrappers | Performance badge automation changes |

## 6. Performance Validation Plan

| Step | Action | Threshold |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Capture N=5 cold/warm pairs | â€” |
| 2 | Extract `pre_plugin_cost_ms` | Must exist (segments_available true) |
| 3 | Compare vs legacy measured pre-plugin (estimated) | â‰¥10% reduction target |
| 4 | Confirm `post_plugin_cost_ms` unchanged | Variation <5% (noise only) |
| 5 | Ensure no unplanned PATH expansion count | PATH element count stable Â±1 |

## 7. Risk Matrix (Stage 2 Specific)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Early Indicator |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| PATH misordering breaks tools | Medium | High | Side-by-side echo diff before commit | Missing command in session |
| Lazy loader recursion | Low | Medium | Self-replacement before invocation | Stack growth / repeated stderr |
| Node stub loads too early | Medium | Medium | Assert absence in perf logs | `nvm` strings in startup log |
| SSH agent duplicate spawn | Low | Medium | Feature test repeated invocation | Two ssh-agent PIDs |
| Added startup regression | Medium | High | Segment regression test failing | `post_plugin_cost_ms` spike |
