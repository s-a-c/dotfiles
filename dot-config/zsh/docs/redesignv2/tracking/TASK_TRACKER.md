# ZSH Redesign Task Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-10 (Part 08.18)  
**Current Stage:** Stage 3 (COMPLETE)  
**Next Milestone:** Stage 4 Feature Layer Implementation

## Recently Completed (Part 08.18)

### ‚úÖ Manifest Test Hardening
- **Issue:** Test failed when run with `zsh -f` (no startup files)
- **Root Causes:**
  1. Core functions not sourced automatically
  2. Associative array syntax incompatible with `::` in keys
  3. Debug function (`zsh_debug_echo`) unavailable in clean shell
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Added automatic sourcing of `10-core-functions.zsh` module
  - Fixed associative array syntax: `HASH[$key]=value` (no quotes)
  - Replaced debug function with conditional echo statements
  - Updated manifest with missing functions (`zf::exports`, `zf::script_dir`)
- **Verification:** Test passes in both direct execution and CI runner

### ‚úÖ Test Runner Migration
- **Issue:** Legacy runner (`run-all-tests.zsh`) did not enforce isolation and was referenced in CI/docs
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Migrated all CI workflows and documentation to `run-all-tests-v2.zsh`
  - Deprecated legacy runner and added warning header
  - Updated onboarding and quick start guides
- **Verification:** All CI and documentation now reference new runner; isolation (`zsh -f`) enforced

### ‚úÖ CI Enforcement & Documentation Update
- All progress trackers, onboarding, and reference docs updated
- Manifest test passes in isolation and CI
- Performance: 334ms startup, 1.9% variance

## Discovered Issues & Technical Debt

### üêõ Known Issues

1. **Design Tests Stage 4 Variables**
   - **Impact:** Low (expected until Stage 4)
   - **Description:** Missing sentinel variables for Stage 4 modules
   - **Resolution:** Will be fixed during Stage 4 implementation

2. **POSTPLUGIN Directory Inconsistency**
   - **Impact:** Medium
   - **Description:** Some tests reference `.zshrc.d.REDESIGN/POSTPLUGIN/` path
   - **Resolution:** Standardize on `.zshrc.d.REDESIGN/` path

3. **Test Runner Output Verbosity**
   - **Impact:** Low
   - **Description:** Direct test runner doesn't show individual test results
   - **Resolution:** Add verbose mode option to runner

### üìù Technical Debt

1. **Test Pattern Consistency**
   - Standardize `functions[(I)pattern]` vs `functions:#pattern` usage
   - Document zsh pattern matching best practices
   - Update all tests to use consistent patterns

2. **Associative Array Documentation**
   - Document quirks with special characters in keys
   - Create helper functions for safe key handling
   - Add examples to developer guide

3. **CI Workflow Consolidation**
   - Further consolidate badge generation workflows
   - Reduce workflow duplication
   - Optimize CI execution time
