## 1. Scope

- Repository: /Users/s-a-c/dotfiles/dot-config
- Lint pass: repository-wide markdown-lint-like checks (using internal `get_errors` linter tooling across text/markdown files)
- Exclusions: files under any `docs/.ARCHIVE/` directories are intentionally excluded from the earlier focused docs pass; this consolidated pass targeted *all tracked text files* but the emphasis is on documentation files.

## 2. Summary

- Total files scanned by the lint pass (tooling): 292
- Files reporting lint errors: 0
- Notable: earlier auto-fix runs and manual edits addressed the majority of earlier findings; this consolidated run confirms no remaining markdown-lint rule violations found by the internal get_errors tooling at the time of the scan.

## 3. Artifact links

- Machine-readable link map: link-existence-map.json
- Earlier detailed lint report: markdown-lint-report.md
- Final human-readable docs-only lint report: final-markdown-lint-report.md

## 4. Details / Notes

- This consolidated report is intentionally high-level: it records the authoritative pass count and final status (no remaining lint errors). If you want a verbose, per-file enumeration of every rule and message (or a JSON export of the linter output), I can generate and commit a companion file in `docs/reports/` (e.g. `consolidated-final-lint-report-details.json`).

- The `.fix.bak` backup files created during the auto-fix run have been deleted (see commit message). Backups were kept until this finalization step; if you want them retained in a separate archive directory instead of removed entirely I can create that archive prior to removing the backups.

## 5. Maintainer next steps

- Review the consolidated report and, if satisfied, open the PR from `feature/zsh-refactor-configuration` into `main` including the `docs/reports` artifacts and the backup removal commit.
- Optionally request the verbose per-file lint output to be attached to the PR for reviewer inspection.
