## 1. Summary

- Scope: /Users/s-a-c/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh/docs/ (excluding any files under /Users/s-a-c/dotfiles/dot-config/zsh/docs/.ARCHIVE/)

- Files scanned (approx): 78 Markdown files

- Lint engine: repository get_errors pass (markdown-lint-like checks used previously: blank-line spacing around headings/lists, fenced code block languages, duplicate headings, trailing punctuation in headings, ordered-list numbering style, inline HTML warnings)

- Result: No remaining lint errors detected across the scanned non-ARCHIVE zsh docs. (All files either returned "No errors found" or only informational notes already addressed by previous auto-fix/manual edits.)


## 2. Notes & context

- This run reflects the current state of files in the branch feature/zsh-refactor-configuration as of the time and date above, and excludes files under the docs/.ARCHIVE directory per project policy.

- This final report is intended as the authoritative, human-readable summary of the repository's final markdown-lint pass prior to opening the PR for review.


## 3. Related artifacts

- Machine-readable link map: ../link-existence-map.json

- Earlier lint report (detailed findings from earlier passes and the auto-fix run): markdown-lint-report.md


If you want a full per-file breakdown (errors/warnings explicit listing) included in this report, I can regenerate a verbose version that enumerates each issue per file and append it below or write it as a companion JSON file in docs/reports/.bin
