# Documentation Maintenance Changes â€” Summary

Generated: 2025-10-07T00:00:00Z

This summary lists the changes applied by the automated maintenance run on the `feature/zsh-refactor-configuration` branch.

## What I changed

- Added `docs/250-next-steps/000-index.md` earlier in the session (index for 250 tasks)
- Created feature stubs: `docs/100-development-tools.md`, `docs/110-productivity-features.md`, `docs/120-terminal-integration.md`, `docs/130-history-management.md`, `docs/140-completion-system.md`
- Canonicalized compliance references in many files to the repository absolute path (user-specified) and flagged them as outside-workspace-unverifiable
- Created `docs/reports/link-existence-map.json` and `docs/reports/markdown-lint-report.md` and `docs/reports/000-index.md`
- Created redesign stubs to satisfy index entries:
  - `docs/400-redesign/050-testing-framework.md` (STUB)
  - `docs/400-redesign/060-risk-assessment.md` (STUB)
  - `docs/400-redesign/070-maintenance-guide.md` (STUB)


## Rationale

- Ensure every index entry resolves to an existing file to avoid broken navigation and to provide a clean baseline for further content work.
- Record findings & lint-like issues in `docs/reports/` for review.


## Next steps

- Expand STUB pages with prioritized content
- Review absolute path compliance references and decide whether to include `ai/` docs in this verification run
- Prepare commit/PR notes and create a PR with these changes
