#
# PURPOSE:
#   Validate whitelist behavior in enhanced PATH normalization (00-path-safety.zsh):
#     - Whitelisted nonexistent absolute path is retained (I2 exception).
#     - Non-whitelisted nonexistent path is removed.
#     - Relative paths are removed even if placed in whitelist (cannot override I3/I8).
#
# SCOPE:
#   Unit-style test (no heavy plugin sourcing). Targets invariants described in test-path-normalization-edges.zsh.
#
# SUCCESS CRITERIA:
#   1. Kept path: /tmp/zsh-whitelist-keep-A must appear exactly once in normalized PATH.
#   2. Dropped path: /tmp/zsh-whitelist-drop-B must NOT appear.
#   3. Relative whitelist entry ./rel-should-drop is NOT retained.
#
# ENV FLAGS:
#   Uses ZSH_PATH_WHITELIST for retention and default pruning settings (ZSH_PATH_ALLOW_NONEXISTENT=0).
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0 PASS
#   1 FAIL
#   2 SKIP (if debug skip variable set)
#
# OPTIONAL SKIP (local only â€“ do not commit with set):
#   export TDD_SKIP_PATH_WHITELIST=1
#
