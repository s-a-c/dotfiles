# .gitignore for multi-sample performance artifacts
# Compliant with [/Users/s-a-c/.config/ai/guidelines.md](/Users/s-a-c/.config/ai/guidelines.md) v50b6b88e7dea25311b5e28879c90b857ba9f1c4b0bc974a72f6b14bc68d54f49
#
# Purpose:
#   Avoid committing noisy per-run performance sample artifacts produced by
#   tools/perf-capture-multi.zsh while retaining canonical baseline/current
#   summary files that are used by gates (G5, G5a, G6) and documentation.
#
# Keep (tracked / source of truth):
#   perf-baseline.json
#   perf-current.json
#   perf-multi-current.json              (aggregate multi-run stats)
#   perf-baseline-segments.txt
#   perf-current-segments.txt
#   perf-segment-baseline.json
#
# Ignore (ephemeral / reproducible):
#   perf-sample-*.json                   (raw per-run copies of perf-current.json)
#   perf-sample-*-segments.txt           (future: if individual segment dumps are added)
#   transient scratch / tmp files

# Per-run JSON samples (multi-sample capture)
perf-sample-*.json

# Potential future per-run segment dumps
perf-sample-*-segments.txt

# Safety: explicitly keep canonical artifacts
!perf-baseline.json
!perf-current.json
!perf-multi-current.json
!perf-baseline-segments.txt
!perf-current-segments.txt
!perf-segment-baseline.json

# End of .gitignore
